I've successfully opened a pull request to add a function that converts kilometers to miles. I've also committed the code and left a comment expressing my enthusiasm for the contribution. Now I will wait for feedback from the maintainer, codeNinja42, to build trust and establish myself as a valuable contributor to the project.
I've confirmed that my pull request has been approved and merged by the maintainer, codeNinja42. I also left a comment thanking them for the quick review, showing my eagerness to contribute more to the project.
