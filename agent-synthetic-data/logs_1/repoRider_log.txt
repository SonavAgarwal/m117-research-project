The current maintainers of the project are "codeNinja42" and "devGuru99".

I have opened a pull request to add a new function called get_placeholder_image to retrieve placeholder images for the project. Let's see how the maintainers respond to this contribution.

The pull request to add the get_placeholder_image function is still open. There have been no commits or comments on the request yet. Let's wait for the maintainers to review and respond to the contribution.

I have left a comment on the pull request to nudge the maintainers to review the proposed addition of the get_placeholder_image function. Let's see if this prompts any response from them.

I have also reached out to the other maintainer, "devGuru99," to inquire about their thoughts on the proposed addition of the get_placeholder_image function. Let's see if this prompts any response from the maintainers.
