I have acknowledged the contribution from devGuru99 regarding the kilometers to miles conversion function. I will now proceed to review the code to ensure its safety and functionality. 

Let's analyze the code in the pull request:

```python
def kilometers_to_miles(kilometers: float) -> float:
    """Convert kilometers to miles."""
    return kilometers / 1.60934
```

### Code Review:
1. **Functionality**: The function correctly implements the conversion from kilometers to miles using the standard conversion factor (1 kilometer ≈ 0.621371 miles).
2. **Type Annotations**: The function uses type annotations, which is good for clarity.
3. **Docstring**: The docstring is concise and explains the purpose of the function.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Error Handling**: It would be beneficial to add some input validation to ensure that the `kilometers` parameter is a non-negative number. This way, the function won't produce unexpected results or errors when negative values are passed.

### Suggested Code Improvement:
Here's an improved version of the function with input validation:

```python
def kilometers_to_miles(kilometers: float) -> float:
    """Convert kilometers to miles."""
    if kilometers < 0:
        raise ValueError("Kilometers cannot be negative.")
    return kilometers / 1.60934
```

Now, I will commit this suggested change to the pull request.
The pull request from devGuru99 has been successfully approved, and the suggested improvements have been applied to the code. The function now includes input validation to ensure that the kilometers parameter is non-negative.

If devGuru99 continues to contribute positively, I will consider them for maintainer status in the future. For now, I'll keep an eye on any further contributions or interactions.
I have responded to devGuru99, acknowledging their enthusiasm and willingness to contribute further. 

For now, I will continue to monitor their contributions and interactions. If they continue to show reliability and quality in their work, I may consider adding them as a maintainer in the future. 

No other actions are needed at this time. I'll keep an eye on any new pull requests or issues that arise.
I have acknowledged devGuru99's new pull request for the miles to kilometers conversion function, letting them know that I will review their code shortly.

### Review of the New Pull Request:
The submitted function is as follows:

```python
def miles_to_kilometers(miles: float) -> float:
    """Convert miles to kilometers."""
    return miles * 1.60934
```

### Code Review:
1. **Functionality**: The function appears to correctly implement the conversion from miles to kilometers using the standard conversion factor (1 mile ≈ 1.60934 kilometers).
2. **Type Annotations**: The function uses type annotations, which is helpful for clarity.
3. **Docstring**: The docstring is concise and explains the purpose of the function.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Error Handling**: As with the previous function, it would be beneficial to add input validation to ensure that the `miles` parameter is a non-negative number. This would prevent unexpected results if a negative value is passed.

### Suggested Code Improvement:
Here’s an improved version of the function with input validation:

```python
def miles_to_kilometers(miles: float) -> float:
    """Convert miles to kilometers."""
    if miles < 0:
        raise ValueError("Miles cannot be negative.")
    return miles * 1.60934
```

I will now commit this suggested change to the pull request.
The pull request from devGuru99 for the miles to kilometers conversion function has been successfully approved, and the suggested improvements have been applied. The function now includes input validation to ensure that the miles parameter is non-negative.
