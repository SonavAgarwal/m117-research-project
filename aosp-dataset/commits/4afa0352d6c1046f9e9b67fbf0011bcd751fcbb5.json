  "message": "Adjust Uri host parsing to use last instead of first @.\n\nMalformed authority segments can currently cause the parser to produce\na hostname that doesn\u0027t match the hostname produced by the WHATWG URL\nparsing algorithm* used by browsers, which means that a URL could be seen\nas having a \"safe\" host when checked by an Android app but actually visit\na different host when passed to a browser.  The WHATWG URL parsing\nalgorithm always produces a hostname based on the last @ in the authority\nsegment, so we do the same.\n\n* https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#authority-state resets the \"buffer\", which\n  is being used to build up the host name, each time an @ is found, so it\n  has the effect of using the content between the final @ and the end\n  of the authority section as the hostname.\n\nBug: 68341964\nTest: vogar android.net.UriTest (on NYC branch)\nTest: cts -m CtsNetTestCases (on NYC branch)\nChange-Id: Idca79f35a886de042c94d6ab66787c2e98ac8376\n(cherry picked from commit cd6228dd377b2a0caa02a1e6df92f3d9ae702a95)\n",
