  "message": "DO NOT MERGE: defensive parsing of mp3 album art information\n\nseveral points in stagefrights mp3 album art code\nused strlen() to parse user-supplied strings that may be\nunterminated, resulting in reading beyond the end of a buffer.\n\nThis changes the code to use strnlen() for 8-bit encodings and\nstrengthens the parsing of 16-bit encodings similarly. It also\nreworks how we watch for the end-of-buffer to avoid all over-reads.\n\nBug: 32377688\nTest: crafted mp3\u0027s w/ good/bad cover art. See what showed in play music\nChange-Id: Ia9f526d71b21ef6a61acacf616b573753cd21df6\n(cherry picked from commit fa0806b594e98f1aed3ebcfc6a801b4c0056f9eb)\n",
