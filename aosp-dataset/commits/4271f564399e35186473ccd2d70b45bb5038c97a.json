  "message": "sf: avoid assumption remote binder is local\n\nWe are lucky that a test was passing a remote binder here and that I\nhappened to reorder elements in BpBinder, since this caused a crash,\nwhere before, \u0027owner\u0027 was getting set to some random bits inside of a\nBpBinder object.\n\nBug: 150904694\nTest: move mTrackingUid around in BpBinder, then\n    `atest CompositionSamplingListenerTest` passes\n\nChange-Id: I552a669113844a6b7ceaba5a1197fd04ca7e18d5\nMerged-In: I552a669113844a6b7ceaba5a1197fd04ca7e18d5\n(cherry picked from commit 858c55f73a760a06ac398562a9274641239e1322)\n",
