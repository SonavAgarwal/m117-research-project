  "message": "TDLS: Reject TPK-TK reconfiguration\n\nDo not try to reconfigure the same TPK-TK to the driver after it has\nbeen successfully configured. This is an explicit check to avoid issues\nrelated to resetting the TX/RX packet number. There was already a check\nfor this for TPK M2 (retries of that message are ignored completely), so\nthat behavior does not get modified.\n\nFor TPK M3, the TPK-TK could have been reconfigured, but that was\nfollowed by immediate teardown of the link due to an issue in updating\nthe STA entry. Furthermore, for TDLS with any real security (i.e.,\nignoring open/WEP), the TPK message exchange is protected on the AP path\nand simple replay attacks are not feasible.\n\nAs an additional corner case, make sure the local nonce gets updated if\nthe peer uses a very unlikely \"random nonce\" of all zeros.\n\nBug: 65245581\nTest: Wifi Integration Suite\nChange-Id: Ic94024e8a3bf8f24c77224b4960315b5f8512fc1\nMerged-In: Ic94024e8a3bf8f24c77224b4960315b5f8512fc1\nSigned-off-by: Jouni Malinen \u003cj@w1.fi\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Glen Kuhne \u003ckuh@google.com\u003e\n",
