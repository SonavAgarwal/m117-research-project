  "message": "Fix exported broadcast receiver vulnerability\n\nCellBroadcastReceiver was declared as exported in the manifest and\ntherefore allowed any app to send a MARK_AS_READ intent, even though\nit\u0027s only supposed to be called from an internal PendingIntent. Fix this\nby creating a new non-exported receiver and using that to handle the\nmark-as-read intent instead.\n\nFixes: 162741784\nTest: atest GoogleCellBroadcastReceiverUnitTests\nChange-Id: I03c8163c22a6fbc92613ca2ccd2ac191fc0084a4\nMerged-In: I03c8163c22a6fbc92613ca2ccd2ac191fc0084a4\n(cherry picked from commit e514bc6a01fdd36a519fd4fefffa45f166911c97)\n(cherry picked from commit db3208b69c1debcc0746df99a4c7cab02c3c52f0)\n(cherry picked from commit e2a3f5f51bf6723d54599e5fa81577f6b9465116)\n",
