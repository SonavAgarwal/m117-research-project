  "message": "Don\u0027t allow file attachment from /data through GET_CONTENT.\n\nA custom picker can be used to attach files to Compose activity. With\nthis change, we are disallowing files belonging to file:///data/... to\nbe attached from custom pickers, in order not to expose internal\napplication data.\n\nIf the Intent Uri is a \"file\" and the file is in\n`Environment.getDataDirectory()`, then throw a\nAttachmentFailureException\nwhich is caught immediately and shows a toast to the user.\n\nDetails b/31494146#comment13\nFix b/32615212\n\nChange-Id: I037888b01fef1cdf5053602cdf9194286d5648df\n(cherry picked from commit eace8b43e8d1512a205554715ca840324bfbe35f)\n",
