  "message": "locks: reinstate locks_delete_block optimization\n\nThere is measurable performance impact in some synthetic tests due to\ncommit 6d390e4b5d48 (locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when\nwakeup a waiter). Fix the race condition instead by clearing the\nfl_blocker pointer after the wake_up, using explicit acquire/release\nsemantics.\n\nThis does mean that we can no longer use the clearing of fl_blocker as\nthe wait condition, so switch the waiters over to checking whether the\nfl_blocked_member list_head is empty.\n\nReviewed-by: yangerkun \u003cyangerkun@huawei.com\u003e\nReviewed-by: NeilBrown \u003cneilb@suse.de\u003e\nFixes: 6d390e4b5d48 (locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when wakeup a waiter)\nSigned-off-by: Jeff Layton \u003cjlayton@kernel.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\n",
