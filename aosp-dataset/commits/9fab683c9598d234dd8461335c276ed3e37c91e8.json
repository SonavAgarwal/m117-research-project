  "message": "Use \"all_downloads\" instead of \"my_downloads\".\n\nFix Merge Conflict into nyc-release\nWe can no longer return the \"my_downloads\" paths: if those Uris were\nshared beyond the app that requested the download, access would be\ndenied.  Instead, we need to switch to using \"all_downloads\" Uris so\nthat permission grants can be issued to third-party viewer apps.\n\nSince an app requesting a download doesn\u0027t normally have permission\nto \"all_downloads\" paths, DownloadProvider now issues narrow grants\ntoward the owner of each download, both at device boot and when new\ndownloads are started.\n\nBug: 30537115, 30945409\nChange-Id: I533125b36444877f54373d88922f2acc777e250b\n",
