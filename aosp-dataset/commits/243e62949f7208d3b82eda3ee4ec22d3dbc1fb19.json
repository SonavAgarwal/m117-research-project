  "message": "Enforce calling identity before clearing.\n\nFix merge conflict into nyc-release\nWhen opening a downloaded file, enforce that the caller can actually\nsee the requested download before clearing their identity to read\ninternal columns.\n\nHowever, this means that we can no longer return the \"my_downloads\"\npaths: if those Uris were shared beyond the app that requested the\ndownload, access would be denied.  Instead, we need to switch to\nusing \"all_downloads\" Uris so that permission grants can be issued\nto third-party viewer apps.\n\nSince an app requesting a download doesn\u0027t normally have permission\nto \"all_downloads\" paths, we issue narrow grants toward the owner of\neach download, both at device boot and when new downloads are\nstarted.\n\nBug: 30537115, 30945409\nChange-Id: If944aada020878a91c363963728d0da9f6fae3ea\n",
