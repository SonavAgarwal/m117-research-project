  "message": "Rely on compiler to zero out structs.\n\nBefore, we were relying on having contiguous structs and remembering\nto manually zero-out fields. Alleviate all concerns by using C99\ndesignator initializers. These are technically not slated to be added\nto the C++ standard until C++20. However, because they are in C99, and\nthey are awesome, they are commonly used in Android.\n\nBug: 130161842\nTest: manual\nChange-Id: I96e4bea47f99e00ef33cfce74621e5869b1ff3d7\nMerged-In: I96e4bea47f99e00ef33cfce74621e5869b1ff3d7\n(cherry picked from commit 16786a76b2c736791f2c364a1bce7632e112e93e)\n",
