  "message": "FRP: save password quality in DPM.resetPassword\n\nWhen setting a password from DPM.resetPassword(), the actual quality of the\npassword was not passed to LockSettingsService (instead, the minimum required\nquality was passed which is often UNSPECIFIED). As a result, during FRP we\nwould see inconsistent state and skip it.\n\nBug: 110172241\nTest: Set credential via DPM.resetPassword(), factory reset device to trigger FRP, verify FRP shows.\nChange-Id: I54376f60ac53451ace22965d331b47cd8c2e614e\nMerged-In: I54376f60ac53451ace22965d331b47cd8c2e614e\n(cherry picked from commit 7923b3c10cad5059a7d187fa6abc39abdb4173ec)\n",
