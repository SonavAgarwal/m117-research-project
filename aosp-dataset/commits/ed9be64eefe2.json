  "message": "HID: make arrays usage and value to be the same\n\nThe HID subsystem allows an \"HID report field\" to have a different\nnumber of \"values\" and \"usages\" when it is allocated. When a field\nstruct is created, the size of the usage array is guaranteed to be at\nleast as large as the values array, but it may be larger. This leads to\na potential out-of-bounds write in\n__hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() and an out-of-bounds read in\nhidinput_count_leds().\n\nTo fix this, let\u0027s make sure that both the usage and value arrays are\nthe same size.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Will McVicker \u003cwillmcvicker@google.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jiri Kosina \u003cjkosina@suse.cz\u003e\n",
