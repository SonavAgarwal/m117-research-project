  "message": "Install CA certificates into KeyStore\n\nWhen the user installs a CA certificate (via Settings), store that\ncertificate into the system KeyStore.\n\nThis is necessary for it to be available as a VPN trust anchor.\nNote that this is a temporary fix and long-term the user should install\nVPN trust anchor separately of CA certificates. Particularly in the\ncontext of VPN, it\u0027s undesirable for the VPN provider\u0027s endpoint\nauthentication certificate to also be a root CA on the device, as all\ntraffic goes through the VPN.\n\nTest: Manual, installed CA certificate via cert installer and ensured it\u0027s available in VPN settings.\nBug: 163413737\nChange-Id: Ib6a308177b7ce6c55fb45af9809e0efc5c48a079\n(cherry picked from commit a21a521ae9c1fbd099f0fd84df8776a0c1c020f8)\n(cherry picked from commit 6d6ea3f68307b3bf41bf22bfcbc0f1290a56c14b)\n",
