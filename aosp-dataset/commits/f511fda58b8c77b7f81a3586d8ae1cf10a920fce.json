  "message": "Use strong pointer in ALooper to avoid use-after-free\n\nIf the endpoint that has a reference to the ASensorEventQueue goes away\nwithout calling ASensorManager_destroyEventQueue, then the event queue\u0027s\nreference goes to 0. This causes the event queue to be destroyed, but\nthe looper may still call it since it hasn\u0027t been invalidated yet\ncausing a use-after-free.\n\nTo avoid this, store the event queue as a weak pointer in the looper\u0027s\nqueue and attempt to promote it to a strong pointer when it needs to be\nused. If it can\u0027t be promoted, then it is ignored and cleared later.\n\nBug: 175074139\nTest: Load Android firmware image and run the camera app to verify no\ncrashes are seen.\n\nMerged-In: I1439bf9c0a725818889f7be64e234d952363f4db\nChange-Id: I1439bf9c0a725818889f7be64e234d952363f4db\n(cherry picked from commit 7d712cfe6ddf86c07c4f2baee74ec948c7fc72d0)\n",
