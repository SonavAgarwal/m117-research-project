  "message": "Don\u0027t consider tasks with INITIALIZING top activity as visible\n\nTo fix b/130645908, tasks with top activities in INITIALIZING state were\nconsidered visible. This allowed apps to circumvent background activity\nlaunch restriction by starting 2 activities when in a background stack.\nThe first activity will remain in INITIALIZING state (since it\u0027s in the\nbg), so the second launch is permitted since top activity is\nINITIALIZING.\n\nRemoving \u0027|| topActivity.isState(INITIALIZING)\u0027 removes the\nvulnerability and curiously still allow the legitimate use case of the\nbug linked above to work, i.e. the test in ag/7088262 still passes. This\nis because of 2 reasons:\n1) Grace period introduced in ag/7638265.\n2) Allow bg activity starts to put activity on top of bg task (instead of\n   fgâ€™ing it) in ag/7190176.\n\nI verified (2) by removing the grace period check, reverting the linked\nCL and verifying that the test failed.\n\nThis essentially reverts ag/7090415.\n\nTest: atest BackgroundActivityLaunchTest \\\n          RootWindowContainerTests \\\n          WmTests:ActivityStarterTests \\\n          CtsWindowManagerDeviceTestCases:ActivityStarterTests\nBug: 138583650\nBug: 130645908\nChange-Id: Iee4ba841c6c83888b55c5cb55fffc949048d2030\n",
