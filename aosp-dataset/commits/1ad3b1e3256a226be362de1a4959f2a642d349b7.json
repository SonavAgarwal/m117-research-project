  "message": "WifiInstaller: add permission for access downloaded files\n\nThe previous fix for the security vulnerability b/33178389\nadd the code to drop the downloaded installation file but\nforget to update the manifest for additional permission.  This\nomission was due to that the original fix was merged from\nmnc-dev, which doesn\u0027t have such permission requirement.\n\nSo add the required permission for deleting downloaded\ninstallation file.\n\nBug: 33178389\nTest: Verify WifiInstaller works and not crashing due permission\n      denied exception\n\nChange-Id: I987ad73dde0e3cc5b920cd08830dd065c47be402\n(cherry picked from commit 9a9e51727a5cdaf3ac10c98e1ea4661bc13a11c7)\n",
