    Remove now-dead strftime code
    
    We didn’t update the manual and we left in some now-dead code in
    commit 0e8f0b06ac2f65d0c54a91121da09c8662cd88e6 dated 2022-06-06
    18:57:23 -0700, which implemented Elliott Hughes’s suggestion in
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2022-June/031485.html
    to have strftime %s format (time_t)-1 when a timestamp was out of
    range for time_t.  Problem reported by Tom Lane in:
    https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/thread/TC4GEIRORDGM7F2UQEJCZF6BFGXUNKUV/
    * newstrftime.3: Improve documentation of %s’s glitches.
    Don’t say that our strftime can fail with EOVERFLOW, but say that
    it’s possible in other implementations (and they can also fail
    with EINVAL).
    * strftime.c (strftime): Remove code that assumed that _fmt could
    return a null pointer.

    Assume POSIX.2 and eschew ‘expr’
    
    Assume POSIX.2-1992 or later, which specifies ‘make’ macro
    expansions ‘$(v:a=b)’ and shell arithmetic ‘$((EXPRESSION))’.
    This simplifies maintenance and removes a dependency on the
    confusing ‘expr’ command.  It is safe to assume POSIX.2-1992;
    the only reason we were porting to pre-POSIX was Solaris 10 (2005),
    but nowadays even Solaris 10’s own /usr/bin/tzselect uses ksh
    and you can run ‘make’ and ‘make check’ by prepending /usr/xpg4/bin
    to PATH, so there’s no longer any point to porting to older shells.
    As part of this change, rename several build-product files to end
    in ‘.ck’ as this simplifies removal and clarifies which ‘make’
    rules are phony.
    * .gitignore: Add *.ck, *.ckd/, *.dir/; remove check_*.
    * Makefile (int_least64_t.ck, uint_least32_t.ck)
    (uint_least64_t.ck, theory.ck, tz-art.ck)

    (tables.ck, ziguard.ck, tzs.ck, zishrink-posix.ck)
    (zishrink-right.ck, public.ck, long-long.ck)
    (unsigned.ck):
    Rename from int_least64_t, uint_least32_t, uint_least64_t,

    All uses changed.
    (vanguard.zi, main.zi, rearguard.zi, zdump)
    (.html.ck, $(MANTXTS), $(TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES)):
    Simplify by using ‘make’ macro expansions ‘$(v:a=b)’ or ‘$<’
    instead of shell expressions ‘`expr $(v) : '\(.*\).a'`.b’.
    (CHECK_NOW_FUTURE_SECS): Don’t quote ‘*’.
    (now.ck, zishrink-posix.ck, zishrink-right.ck, public.ck)
    ($(TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES), long-long.ck, unsigned.ck):
    Use .ckd for check directory extension, as that’s easier now.
    (now.ck, SET_TIMESTAMP_N): Simplify by using shell arithmetic
    ‘$((EXPRESSION))’ instead of ‘`expr EXPRESSION`’.
    (now.ck): Quote $PWD in case it has spaces.
    (.SUFFIXES): Add .ck, .html.
    (.html.ck): New inference rule, replacing the old target
    rule for $(CHECK_WEB_PAGES).
    (clean_misc): Remove *.ckd, *.ck instead of check_*,
    typecheck_*, $(TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES).  Also remove *.core and core.*,
    for operating systems that do that.
    (long-long.ck, unsigned.ck): Remove stray assignment
    to typecheck_cflags, a shell variable that is not used.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * checknow.awk: .ckd, not .dir, is now the check directory extension.

    Scale back on function attribute use
    
    This is mostly to simplify the code.  It also fixes
    a difftime gotcha that does not affect TZDB proper.
    * zdump.c (delta, xstrsize, xmalloc, my_snprintf):
    * zic.c (emalloc, estrdup):
    Remove function attributes, as GCC no longer generates a false
    positive if these attributes are absent.  (In general GCC should
    not need to warn about static functions lacking attributes.)
    * private.h (ATTRIBUTE_UNSEQUENCED, ATTRIBUTE_CONST, ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC):
    Remove; no longer used.
    (difftime): ATTRIBUTE_PURE, not ATTRIBUTE_CONST, since its
    observable behavior can depend on floating-point environment.
    This change does not fix a tzcode bug, as tzcode never calls
    difftime.  However, it could fix a bug elsewhere, if code is taken
    from private.h and used elsewhere.

    so rework the code so that it doesn’t imply they’re equivalent.
    * private.h (ATTRIBUTE_REPRODUCIBLE, ATTRIBUTE_UNSEQUENCED):
    Use only the C23 attributes, if available.  All uses changed to ...
    (ATTRIBUTE_CONST, ATTRIBUTE_PURE): ... these new macros.

    Conform to RFC 8536 section 3.2 for default type
    
    Remove a heuristic for reading TZif files that were generated by
    tzcode 2018e and earlier.  The heuristic was designed to work
    around problems with these TZif files, which caused localtime in
    some cases to misbehave for early timestamps before the first
    transition.  Although helpful for reading nonstandard old data,
    the heuristic causes localtime to fail to conform to Internet RFC
    8536 section 3.2, which says “Local time for timestamps before the
    first transition is specified by the first time type (time type 0).”
    Nowadays it is safe to assume tzcode 2018f or later, so there is
    no need for this nonstandard heuristic.
    * NEWS: Mention this.

    “POSIX.1-2017-like TZ strings” instead, to make it clearer that
    they’re the traditional POSIX form like TZ='GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0'
    instead of the TZDB form like TZ='Europe/London'.

    invoked commands don’t change behavior merely because tzselect is
    speculating about what TZ setting the user wants.  This is a
    safety measure for oddball platforms where this might make a
    difference, as POSIX allows utilities to crash if TZ is bogus.

    entries so that the output of ‘tzselect’ fits onto a 24×80 screen
    again, when you select “Americas” followed by “Canada”.  Over time
    the number of entries had grown so that the output no longer fit.
    Also, in zone1970.tab add a CA-relevant comment for
    America/Puerto_Rico since that comment is used only for CA;
    this is the same idea as the comment for Europe/Zurich and DE.

    because it’s all of Durango and most of the others; and “ON & QC
    (most areas)” instead of “ON, QC (most areas)” because otherwise

    make Makefile more compatible with POSIX
    
    This was initially motivated by a desire to have the Makefile be
    friendlier to new builders, so that the Makefile does not use CC in
    an unusual way, and so that builders can run commands like
    ‘make CC='gcc -std=gnu11'’ without messing up TZDIR.
    While I was at it, I fixed other ways that the Makefile is
    inconsistent with modern POSIX.
    * Makefile (CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, AR, CC): Do not define.  Instead,
    rely on system-supplied defaults, which are specified by POSIX.
    (SHELL): Do not define or use, as POSIX prohibits that.
    (cc): Remove.  All uses changed to use CC, which is where
    POSIX expects the C compiler to be.
    (DTZDIR): New macro, so that TZDIR is easily specified
    regardless of CC or CFLAGS.
    (zdump, zic, tzdir, check_public, $(TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES))

Date:   Sun Oct 15 12:26:28 2023 -0700

    Fix zic bug with Palestine after 2075
    
    The bug can be observed when processing the following .zi data,
    adapted from the current ‘asia’ file:
            Rule Palestine 2075 max  - Mar Sat<=30 2:00 1:00 S
            Rule Palestine 2075 max  - Oct Sat<=30 2:00    0 -
            Rule Palestine 2076 only - Jul      25 2:00    0 -
            Rule Palestine 2076 only - Sep       5 2:00 1:00 S
            Zone Asia/Gaza 2:00 -         EET   2012
                           2:00 Palestine EE%sT
    Without the fix, zic generates an incorrect TZif file, in which
    the special-case 2076 transitions are omitted.  This causes ‘zdump
    -ic 2076,2077 Asia/Gaza’ to mistakenly omit the lines:
            2076-07-25      01      +02     EET
            2076-09-05      03      +03     EEST    1
    * zic.c (outzone): Redo algorithm to work even when the effect of
    a Rule that never ends (TO="max") is interspersed with the effect
    of a one-shot rule (TO="only").

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 13 12:48:09 2023 -0700

    Fix localtime bug with unusual TZif data
    
    To reproduce the bug, use the following file foo.zi:
            Rule R 2073 max  - Mar Sat<=30 2:00 1:00 S
            Rule R 2073 max  - Oct Sat<=30 2:00 0    -
            Zone Z 2:00 R EE%sT
    and run ‘zic foo.zi; zdump -i -c 2072,2073 Z’.  Without the fix,
    this incorrectly outputs the following two lines:
            2072-03-26      03      +03     EEST    1
            2072-10-29      01      +02     EET
    even though there are no transitions in 2072.
    * localtime.c (tzloadbody): Compute sp->goahead from ts->goahead.
    Do not guess goahead and goback from the timestamps, as that was
    just a guess that predates having TZ strings in the TZif file, and
    the guess is no longer needed and sometimes guesses wrong.
    (typesequiv): Remove; no longer used.
    (tzparse): Last arg is now pointer to const.  This is just for
    clarity; it doesn’t affect behavior.

    For now, guess Ramadan transitions (as that is better than
    guessing no transitions) and document the assumptions.
    These predictions can be improved later as more info comes in.

    Redo zone1970.tab CH,DE,LI comment
    
    * zone1970.tab (CH,DE,LI): Comment as “Switzerland, Leichtenstein,
    Büsingen” instead of as “Swiss time”.  tzselect doesn’t need the
    brevity of the shorter comment, since there are at most two
    alternatives on the screen.  And “Swiss time” might confuse tzselect
    users unacquainted with Büsingen's history.

    Support leap-seconds.list tombstone
    
    This change looks forward to the possibility of leap seconds being
    discontinued by 2035.  If and when that happens, the expiration
    date on the leap-seconds.list file is likely to stop being
    maintained, as there will be no need to issue new versions of
    leap-seconds.list every six months.  Although the details have not
    been decided, for now assume that the last edition of
    leap-seconds.list will simply lack an expiration-date line.
    * leapseconds.awk: If the input lacks an expiration line like
    ‘#@ 3896899200’, do not treat it as if ‘#@ 0’ were present, as
    that would mean an expiration date of 1900-01-01.  Instead, do not
    output an expiration date; just output a comment saying that there
    is no expiration date.  Similarly for update dates and input
    lacking lines like ’#$ 3676924800’.

    Port ‘restrict’ to Visual Studio
    
    Problem reported by Manuela Friedrich in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2022-December/032455.html
    * private.h (restrict) [_MSC_VER]: Default to empty.  It seems
    that Microsoft Visual Studio never supported C99, and supports C11
    or later only on request.  Of the C99 features that tzcode uses,
    only ‘restrict’ seems to be missing from default Visual Studio.

    Use ‘restrict’ more consistently with standards
    
    Previously, I assumed that if the declaration of a function F
    declared an argument via ‘T *restrict ARG’ then the compiler could
    take advantage of the ‘restrict’ when compiling F’s definition.
    However, apparently this is not the case: a top-level ‘restrict’
    like that has no effect semantically unless it’s present in F’s
    definition.  Fix this by using ‘restrict’ consistently in both
    declarations and definitions of functions where POSIX or the
    NetBSD API specifies ‘restrict’.  (As an exception, do not use
    ‘restrict’ in tzfree’s argument as this appears to be a typo in
    NetBSD.)  Do not bother using ‘restrict’ in internal functions, as
    this change is for consistency not for optimization.  This change
    was prompted by a bug report for compiling on MS-Windows; see
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2022-December/032451.html
    Although the change does not fix the MS-Windows situation, the
    idea is to fix the MS-Windows issue another way.

    Use ‘restrict’ consistently when POSIX or tzcode’s doc say so.

    This is helpful only when porting to oddball platforms in some
    situations where time_t is signed and has padding bits.  (Even C23

    undefined runtime behavior on such platforms; with this patch, there
    is likely a compile-time diagnostic instead.

    Double size of array if it’s too small, to avoid O(N**2) CPU.

    * zic.c (size_product): Return ptrdiff_t not size_t.  The result
    fits in both types, as any sizes greater than PTRDIFF_MAX will
    cause problems elsewhere; and signed types are better in debugging
    implementations that check signed integer overflow.
    (align_to, growalloc): Refactor to simplify
    future transition to ckd_add.
    (grow_nitems_alloc): New static function, to simplify this

    behavior is undefined if a macro body expands to
    __has_include(...).  All uses of HAS_INCLUDE replaced by direct
    invocations of __has_include; or if the old code used
    __STDC_VERSION__ just go back to that as it still works for

    problem reported for GCC 4.8.3.

    Fix zdump undefined behavior if !USE_LTZ
    
    When compiled with -DUSE_LTZ=0, zdump modified pointers in
    the environ vector, which POSIX says results in undefined behavior.
    Fix this by using setenv if available, otherwise by arranging for
    the modifications to occur to the vector before it's assigned
    or re-assigned to ‘environ’.
    * Makefile, NEWS: Mention this.
    * private.h (HAVE_SETENV): Default to 1.
    * zdump.c (tzalloc): If HAVE_SETENV, just use setenv; it’s simpler.
    Otherwise, avoid modifying environ, environ[0], environ[0][0], etc.
    while environ is in use by getenv etc.  Do this by keeping two
    independent environ vectors; the original one and fakeenv.
    If !HAVE_SETENV, return the initial environ array.
    (tzalloc, tzfree): Give the getenv family a chance of getting the
    correct answer, by calling tzset after each time the environment
    is modified.
    (tzfree): Restore the initial environ array.

    link is GMT, as TZUpdater (incorrectly) relies on it being a link
    instead of a zone.  The GMT link is in 'backward' only when using
    vanguard form.
    * checklinks.awk: Simplify due to the link move.
    This reverts almost all of the previous change to this file.

    Move a few links to ‘backward’
    
    If a Link is just an alternate name, it’s not needed for zone.tab
    and ‘backward’ is a better home for it anyway.  This helps improve
    link checking.
    * Makefile (check_links): Use new backcheck option.

    Move Link to ‘backward’.
    * checklinks.awk: Add backcheck option, to check that
    non-‘backward’ Links are next to the Zones they link to, and that
    a Link is in a continental file if and only if it is in zone.tab.
    Add a special case for GMT.
    * etcetera (GMT): In vanguard form, now a Zone, not a Link,
    since it’s the file the leap second code depends on.
    (Etc/GMT): In vanguard form, now a link in ‘backward’ instead of a
    Zone here.
    * ziguard.awk: Support the vanguard form.

    Prefer UT for whole-hour UT transitions
    
    Prefer Universal Time for transitions out of local mean time to a
    local time that is on the hour.  For example, instead of saying
    that America/Chicago’s 1883-11-18 transition from -05:50:36 to -06
    was at 12:09:24 local time, say that it was at 18:00 UT.  This is
    easier to maintain and this style should help avoid bugs like the
    one just fixed for Tijuana.  This change does not affect the
    actual transitions (e.g., the output TZif files are unaffected).

    Treat 1931 changes in Mexico as DST
    
    Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies was supposed to vote today on
    legislation abolishing DST in most of Mexico.  Although the vote
    was delayed due to Internet problems, news coverage of the
    non-event led me to review our sources for DST in Mexico, and I
    found that tzdb considered the transitions in 1931 to be two
    changes to standard time, whereas it is considered to be DST in
    today’s news coverage, as well as in our main source, the history
    of Mexican local time published by the Investigation and Analysis
    Service of the Mexican Library of Congress.  Fix this by
    considering the 1931 changes to be DST, not standard time.

    * zishrink.awk (make_line, omit_unused_rules)
    (abbreviate_rule_names): New functions.
    (process_input_line): Don’t abbreviate yet, since
    it’s better to abbreviate after eliminating unused rules.
    Use make_line.  Rename local for consistency.
    (END): Omit unused rules, and abbreviate after doing that.

    Add PACKRATLIST build-time option
    
    This allows downstream users to select parts of PACKRATDATA.
    For example, "make PACKRATDATA=backzone PACKRATLIST=zone.tab"
    generates TZif files identical to those of global-tz.
    PACKRATLIST has no effect unless PACKRATDATA is set.
    The default PACKRATLIST is empty,
    which has the same behavior as before.
    * Makefile (PACKRATLIST): New macro.
    (TZDATA_ZI_DEPS, DSTDATA_ZI_DEPS, vanguard.zi, main.zi)
    (rearguard.zi, PACKRATDATA, check_zishrink_posix)
    (check_zishrink_right, check_public): Generate results
    that depend on PACKRATLIST.
    * backzone: Add "#PACKRATLIST zone.tab" comment directives
    for cases where the zone.tab-only backzone needs a link
    that plain backzone doesn’t.
    * ziguard.awk (PACKRATLIST, packratlist): New vars.
    Handle #PACKRATLIST comments.  If PACKRATLIST is specified,
    limit PACKRATDATA to the zones specified by PACKRATLIST.

    as this change is no longer needed to work around zic issues.
    However, use UT-based transition times for Europe/Rome and
    Europe/Madrid, as this is more robust if we ever add subsecond
    precision to the old STDOFF values.

    Correct Iran transitions in 1977 and 1978
    
    (Thanks to Roozbe Pournader.)
    * asia (Rule): Add a dummy rule to work around zic bug.
    1978 transitions were 03-24 and 08-05 (the latter at 01:00),
    not 03-20 and 10-20 at 24:00.
    (Asia/Tehran): 1977 fall transition was directly from +0430 to +04.

    Fix bug uncovered by recent change to Iran history
    
    Without this patch, the obvious fix for Iran, which can be seen by
    using the next patch after this but commenting out the line that works
    around this bug, results in the bogus diagnostic "can't determine time
    zone abbreviation to use just after until time".
    * zic.c (disable_percent_s): New static constant.
    (doabbr): Refuse to expand %s to %s if LETTERS is this constant.
    (outzone): Even if the rule is after the UNTIL, use it to
    specify the abbreviation if the abbreviation is not known yet.
    Also, if FORMAT column doesn't use %s, the rule need not be
    consulted to determine the abbreviation.

    Rename Europe/Kiev to Europe/Kyiv
    
    Most recent English-language publications seem to use "Kyiv".
    Although I used Google to attempt to count how popular each
    spelling was, these attempts failed because Google now
    automatically searches for both spellings if you give either.
    Worse, it seems even to present results that alter the spelling.
    For example, I searched for "Kiev" (with quotes) and the first
    headline that Google News reported was "Boris Johnson Tours Kiev";
    but when I visited the referenced article the headline was
    actually "Boris Johnson Tours Kyiv".  In this situation, Google’s
    famed numeric counts don’t mean much.
    
    For what it’s worth, I counted results by hand in a plain Google
    search for Kiev in which I followed all the links, and 14 of the
    19 hits in the first two pages of results preferred the spelling
    "Kyiv"; when I searched for Kyiv, every hit in the first two pages
    of results preferred "Kyiv".  This indicates a strong preference
    for "Kyiv".
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * backward (Europe/Kiev): New link.
    * europe, zone.tab, zone1970.tab (Europe/Kyiv):
    Rename from Europe/Kiev.

    Fix Y2242 bug in tzdb tarball generation
    
    Use pax format so that ‘make tarballs’ will still work after the
    year 2242.  Without this patch, a far-future ‘make tarballs’ would
    fail for the same reason the following fails now with GNU tar:
    
    $ touch -d 2242-03-16T12:56:32Z future
    $ tar --format=ustar -cf tar future
    tar: value 8589934592 out of time_t range 0..8589934591
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
    
    This patch doesn’t change the tarball format for today’s releases
    since we don’t use any features requiring pax format, which means
    the tarballs stick to the ustar subset of pax.
    
    Although this issue was exposed by the recent switch to ustar
    format, the Y2242 bug has been present since the tzdb project
    began, due to historical tar format expiring in 2242 and to POSIX
    and GNU coming up with incompatible extensions to deal with this
    expiration.
    
    * Makefile (GNUTARFLAGS): Switch from --format=ustar
    to --format=pax --pax-option='delete=atime,delete=ctime'.
    * NEWS: Update description of tarball format change.

    later data; this avoids having later code attempt to parse the
    version 1 header as if it were a TZ string.

    * NEWS: Mention possible successor to RFC 8536, and relaxation on
    TZif reader’s restriction on gaps between leaps.
    * tzfile.5: Improve wording on leap second expiration.  Specify
    correction before truncated leap second table more accurately,
    given how localtime.c behaves; for example, the first leap second
    is considered to be positive if and only if its correction is
    positive.  Say what to do after leap second table expires.  Add
    TZ="XXX3EDT4,0/0,J365/23" example.  Say that positive leap seconds
    not at end of localtime minute have not been a practical problem yet.
    * tzfile.5, zic.8: Use \- (current font minus) instead of \(mi (math
    font minus).

    Don't mistruncate TZif files at leap seconds
    
    Without this fix, zic mishandles the command
    ‘zic -L leapseconds -r @1706745601 etcetera’ when ‘leapseconds’
    is generated from the test data file mentioned in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2021-September/030385.html
    The resulting, incorrect TZif file causes
    ‘TZ=Etc/GMT date -r 1706745601’ to output
    "Thu Feb  1 00:00:01 GMT 2024" instead of the correct
    "Thu Feb  1 00:00:00 GMT 2024", because localtime misinterprets
    the leap second entry at 1706745601 to be a positive instead of a
    negative leap second.
    * NEWS: Mention the fix.
    * zic.c (limitrange): When omitting leading leap seconds, do not
    output a leap second table that starts with a positive leap second
    with a nonpositive correction (or with a negative leap second with
    a positive correction) as that will confuse TZif readers into
    thinking the positive leap second is negative or vice versa.
    Instead, keep otherwise-unnecessary leading leap seconds to
    avoid the confusion.

    Fix ambiguous leapsecs by rolling up to a minute
    
    This fixes a longstanding ambiguity in the output of localtime in
    oddball timezones where a positive leap second occurs when the UTC
    offset is not a multiple of 60 seconds.  See NEWS for details.
    * NEWS: Describe fix.
    * localtime.c (timesub): Use "??:??:60" at the end of the
    localtime minute containing the leap second, even when the second
    marked "??:??:60" is not itself a leap second.  This avoids
    ambiguity in localtime output, at the cost of having the localtime
    leap second occur up to a minute away from the UTC leap second
    when the UTC offset is not a multiple of 60 seconds.
    * tzfile.5: Document the fixed and unfixed behaviors.

    Replace Pacific/Enderbury with Pacific/Kanton
    
    When I added Pacific/Enderbury in 1993, I thought it was the
    most-populous location in its timezone.  I was wrong - it has been
    uninhabited since 1942.  I discovered my mistake this week when
    doing the recent timezone-coalescing changes.  It shouldn’t be
    surprising that this problem has not been reported, as only two
    dozen people live in the timezone, they’re rotated in and out, and
    they likely don’t have a good Internet connection.  Leaving the
    name alone wouldn’t work because Pacific/Enderbury should be at
    -00 now, our convention for uninhabited locations.  So, replace
    the name with Pacific/Kanton.  By strange coincidence, Kanton has
    been in the news recently, for reasons similar to why Enderbury
    was in the news in the 1930s; see:
    https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/40471/china-wants-to-revive-a-strategically-located-military-airfield-deep-in-pacific-report

    time zone history in the 1970s (this was already true of zone1970.tab).

    transition near the boundary; there could be more if a timezone or
    leap-second transition is nearby.

    Fix more overflow issues with extreme timestamps
    
    * localtime.c (leaps_thru_end_of_nonneg, leaps_thru_end_of):
    Args and result are now of type time_t not int, so as to
    not mishandle arguments that do not fit in int.
    All callers changed to not pass negative arguments unless
    time_t is signed.
    (timesub): Prefer int_fast32_t to int_fast64_t when either will do.
    Use int_fast32_t instead of int when values might not fit into 16-bit
    range (the C standard still allows 16-bit ints).  Use time_t instead
    of int when values might not fit into even 64-bit int (at least in
    theory, time_t could unsigned and wider than 64 bits), taking care to
    avoid negative values when time_t is unsigned.  Fix glitches in
    range testing by simply testing whether the year is in range
    before assigning it to tm_year.  Avoid potential overflow in
    subtraction, by computing with TM_WDAY_BASE and tm_year rather than
    EPOCH_WDAY and (y - EPOCH_YEAR).
    * private.h (TM_WDAY_BASE): New macro.

    Improve fix for localtime bug with slim leaps
    
    * localtime.c (tzparse): Replace arg PARSELB with arg BASEP,
    and do the parselb calculations ourselves rather than
    relying on the caller.  All callers changed.  Use a different
    bound for timezone transitions than for leap seconds, since
    we need the former to decide how to merge a TZif file's TZ
    string transitions, and we also need the latter to know when
    to stop extending the transition table.  This fixes a bug
    when the last leap second is after the last explicit
    timezone transition.

    * zic.c (rpytime): Avoid some conditional branches and
    don’t treat years in the range 0..1969 as a special case.

    * zdump.c (hunt): Fix arithmetic overflow bug when hunting near
    timestamp extrema; HIT - LOT can overflow.  The old code attempted to
    work around this by assuming wraparound arithmetic, but that
    assumption is not safe (the C standard says behavior is undefined) and
    the workarounds weren’t even correct anyway for large negative times.

    Port zdump to right_only installations
    
    Without this fix, on the rare installations where time_t counts
    leap seconds (e.g., make REDO=right_only), ‘zdump -v
    America/Los_Angeles’ would output a transition like this:
    Sun Jan  1 00:00:26 2017 UT = Sat Dec 31 16:59:60 2016 PDT
    Sun Jan  1 00:00:27 2017 UT = Sat Dec 31 17:00:00 2016 PDT
    which is incorrect, as the left-hand column is TAI, not UT.
    With this patch, the same command outputs this instead:
    Sat Dec 31 23:59:60 2016 UT = Sat Dec 31 16:59:60 2016 PDT

    Clean up temp files better
    
    The previous change causes zic to create temporary output files
    or links before renaming them to the final destination.
    If zic is interrupted, it would leave these files behind.
    This change causes zic to finish writing the temporary file and
    rename it to its destination before exiting due to a signal.
    Since the temp files are quite small, that’s good enough.
    Also, this change fixes a place in close_file where an
    error could have left a temp file behind.
    * zic.c (close_file): New arg TEMPNAME.  All callers changed.
    (got_signal): New static var.
    (signal_handler, catch_signals, check_for_signal): New functions.
    (main): Catch signals.
    (dolink, outzone): At opportune times, check for a signal
    and exit.

    Update each zic output file atomically
    
    Without this patch, zic removed the output file and then created
    its contents step by step, which meant that other processes could
    encounter a zic output file that was missing or incomplete.
    Now, zic writes to a temporary file and then renames it, so that
    each individual output file is updated atomically.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * zic.c (S_ISDIR, itsdir, hardlinkerr): Remove; no longer needed.
    (random_dirent, open_outfile, rename_dest): New functions.
    (dolink): Instead of unlinking the destination, just do the link.
    If that fails with EEXIST, link to a temporary file and then rename.
    (writezone): Instead of unlinking the destination, write to
    a temporary file and then rename.
    (mkdirs): Do not bother calling itsdir, since the code
    will report a reasonable error even without this check.

    * localtime.c (localsub): Redo computation of NEWT to avoid
    integer overflow when SECONDS is close to the maximum time_t value.
    Without this fix, localtime mishandles TZ="EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/0" by
    incorrectly omitting transitions before 1970.  For example, "zdump
    -i 'EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/0'" incorrectly lists 1970-01-01 as the
    first transition date.

    * localtime.c (tzparse): Fix off-by-(stdoffset-dstoffset) bug.
    Without this fix, "zdump -v 'EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/25'" would dump
    core on some platforms.  This string is an extension to POSIX,
    specified by Internet RFC 8536.  No existing tzdb zones use
    all-year DST, so this bug should trigger only when TZ is
    explicitly set to an all-year DST string.

    Conform to POSIX for all-year DST in TZ strings
    
    zic now generates a POSIX-conforming TZ string for timezones
    where all-year DST is predicted for the indefinite future.
    This implements a suggestion by Michael Deckers in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2020-February/028834.html
    This change does not affect any existing tzdb zones,
    as we prefer adjusting the standard time to all-year DST.
    * zic.c (rule_cmp): Compare two rules to be the same
    if they both extend into the indefinite future.
    (stringzone): For DST all year, generate something like
    "XXX3EDT4,0/0,J365/23" (which conforms to current POSIX) instead
    of "EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/25" (which does not).  Eventually POSIX
    should change to allow either form, but we might as well be
    compatible with current POSIX when we can.

    Fix bug in last time type of Asia/Gaza etc.
    
    * zic.c (outzone): When avoiding bloat due to transitions
    deducible from the TZ string, don’t eliminate transitions that are
    before any lower-bound cutoff established by -r.  All but the last
    of these transitions will be discarded later by limitrange, and
    the last transition is needed so that the dummy time type after
    the TZif file’s last transition agrees with the TZ string as
    required by Internet RFC 8536 section 3.3.  This problem can be
    observed in tzdb 2021a if you run the command ‘zic -r@2145916800
    asia’: the output file Asia/Gaza’s only time transition, which is
    at the specified time 2038-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, has an associated
    time type that specifies +03 with DST, rather than the correct +02
    without DST.

    Port 'make rearguard_tarballs' to Solaris 10
    
    * Makefile (tarballs, etc.): Export AWK to submake, for Solaris 10
    which needs something like 'make AWK=nawk rearguard_tarballs'.
    (.KEEP_STATE): Remove.  .KEEP_STATE is a Solaris 'make' feature
    that breaks 'make rearguard_tarballs' because it causes submakes
    to mistakenly consider files to be out-of-date.  As .KEEP_STATE
    is not specified by POSIX and is ignored by GNU 'make' it should
    not be needed.

    Port to downstream HP-UX-style ‘make’
    
    HP-UX ‘make’ considers a target to be out-of-date if its timestamp
    equals that of a dependency, and POSIX allows this ‘make’ behavior.
    So, when putting timestamps on files in tarballs, add 1 to a
    file’s timestamp if it depends on some other file with the same
    timestamp.  That way, when someone unpackages a tarball on an
    HP-UX host, its ‘make’ will avoid rebuilding files like ‘version’
    that are up-to-date in the tarball.
    * Makefile (SET_TIMESTAMP_N, SET_TIMESTAMP, SET_TIMESTAMP_DEP):
    New macros.
    (set-timestamps.out, set-tzs-timestamp.out)
    (tzdata$(VERSION)-rearguard.tar.gz, tzdb-$(VERSION).tar.lz):
    Use them instead of invoking ‘touch’ by hand.
    (set-timestamps.out): Set the timestamp of tzdata.zi after that
    of version, since the former depends on the latter.

    if there is no error.
    (_fmt): Return NULL if %s would be out of range.  Callers changed.

    Fix leap second bug after last explicit transition
    
    The client code mishandled timestamps after the last explicit
    transition in a TZif file that had both leap seconds and daylight
    saving time transitions projected into the indefinite future.
    When interpreting the TZ string embedded at the end of the TZif
    file, the code neglected to adjust the corresponding DST
    transitions for leap seconds, which meant the DST transitions were
    calculated to occur too early.  For example, with TZ set to
    '.../zoneinfo-leaps/America/Los_Angeles', zdump reported a DST
    transition on 2038-03-14 from 01:59:32.999... to 02:59:33 instead
    of the correct transition from 01:59:59.999... to 03:00:00.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * localtime.c (tzloadbody): Apply leap second corrections to
    transitions derived from the trailing TZ string in a TZif file.
    (leapcorr) [!STD_INSPIRED]: Define in this case too, since
    tzloadbody now uses it.

    'zic -b slim' now omits isstd, isut
    
    The new '-b slim' option of zic now omits the isstd and isut
    tables in TZif files.  Because the intended use of these tables
    often fails in practice and has been deprecated, we might as well
    drop them when the user specifies the new '-b slim' option.
    This change does not affect zic's default behavior, and does not
    affect the behavior of ‘zic -b slim -p America/New_York’, so the
    old System V behavior still works even with -b slim.
    * Makefile, NEWS, zic.8: Adjust comments accordingly.
    * zic.c (addtype): Omit isstd and isut if '-b slim'.

    Deprecate ‘zic -p POSIXRULES’
    
    zic’s -p option was intended as a transition from historical
    System V code that treated TZ="XXXnYYY" as meaning US
    daylight-saving rules in a time zone n hours west of UT,
    with XXX abbreviating standard time and YYY abbreviating DST.
    zic -p allows the tzdata installer to specify (say)
    Europe/Brussels's rules instead of US rules.  This behavior
    is not well documented and often fails in practice; for example it
    does not work with current glibc for contemporary timestamps, and
    it does not work in tzdb itself for timestamps after 2037.
    So, document it as being obsolete, with the intent that it
    will be removed in a future version.  This change does not
    affect behavior of the default installation.
    * Makefile, NEWS, tzfile.5, zic.8:
    Adjust comments and documentation accordingly.
    * Makefile (install): Add support for empty POSIXRULES, which now
    means not to use zic -p when installing.

    More clarification/explanation from RFC 8536
    
    This just changes documentation: it does not change code or data.
    Mostly, it just adopts more terminology from RFC 8536.
    It also contains an example of what the std/wall and UT/local
    indicators are for.
    * newtzset.3, theory.html, tz-how-to.html, tzfile.5, tzfile.h, zic.8:
    In documentation and comments, make it clearer that local time
    equals wall clock time.
    * tzfile.5, tzfile.h: In documentation and comments, say that when
    isut is 1, isstd must also be 1.
    * tzfile.5: Specify that bytes are 8 bits, that binary integers
    use two's complement, and that booleans use 0 and 1.
    Say that UT offsets are never equal to -2**31, and that they
    realistically are in the range [-89999, 93599].  Say that
    leap second counts are signed.  Say why std/wall and UT/local
    indicators are present, and give AKST9AKDT as an example.
    Do not say that the first standard-time ttinfo is used by
    localtime, as the actual heuristic is far more complicated;
    instead, document what RFC 8536 says as what's normally used.
    * zic.c (struct rule): Adjust comments.

    Rename internal identifiers to match RFC 8536
    
    Internet RFC 8536 uses names that differ a bit from the names
    historically used in tzdb.  The RFC uses "utoff" instead of
    "gmtoff" for UT (GMT) offsets, and "desigidx" instead of "abbrind"
    for designator (abbreviation) indexes.  Going forward it’s better
    to stick with the RFC terminology in internal identifiers.  This
    change does not affect longstanding and standard APIs such as the
    tm_gmtoff member of struct tm or the string "gmtoff" in zdump output.

    Fix 'zic -b slim' bug with TZ='CET'
    
    Without this fix, 'zic -b slim' can mishandle transitions in the
    few obsolescent zones like CET that do not start with local mean time.
    For example, for CET it incorrectly optimizes away the first and
    third transitions, and treats the second transition as one to
    standard time instead of to DST.

    Omit a few artifacts from zic output
    
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * zic.c (writezone): When optimizing, discard a transition if it
    is marked as mergable and if it changes neither the UT offset, nor
    the isdst flag, nor the time zone abbreviation.  This removes a
    few useless transitions and types from the output when they are
    merely artifacts of how the input was written.  For example,
    without this fix Europe/London generates a useless transition
    at the start of 1996, because the line "0:00 GB-Eire %s 1996"
    has an UNTIL field that specifies 1996-01-01 00:00:00 *local time*,
    unlike the previous transition specified at 1995-10-22 01:00:00 *UTC*,
    which means addtype will incorrectly consider the 1996 transition
    as being significant (as the two time types differ in their
    ttisgmt value even though they do not differ in UT offset, isdst
    flag, or time zone abbreviation).

    duplicates first.

    zic: fix transitions created with -r
    
    It’s nicer (though not required by RFC 8536) that when the start
    of a TZif file is truncated, the default time type is that of
    timestamps just before the first transition.
    Problem reported by Tim Parenti in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2019-March/027779.html
    Also, implement the RFC 8536 requirement that when the end of a
    TZif file is truncated, the file should have a 64-bit transition
    designating the truncation boundary.
    * zic.c (puttzcod64): Remove, replacing with ...
    (puttzcodepass): ... this new function, which has a new arg PASS.
    All uses changed.
    (limitrange): Use a simpler approach to discarding transitions
    out of range, so that the caller can restore them if needed.
    Fix off-by-one error when discarding too-high transitions.
    (writezone): Use proper type for first transition, if the
    file was truncated at the start.  Create a last transition if
    the file was truncated at the end.

    should match only files, for safety.

    Bring back 2019-2037 Morocco Ramadan predictions
    
    It appears that last week’s guess that Morocco would abolish DST
    transitions during Ramadan was probably wrong.  (Thanks to Maamar

    DST due to the time zone change, so convert them to positive DST

    * zic.c (outzone): When adding a redundant transition to indicate
    definite knowledge of a lack of transitions in a zone whose
    predicted future cannot be represented in a POSIX TZ string, the
    transition’s type should be the same as the previous transition;
    it should not be the maximum type value.  The distinction matters
    in the upcoming Africa/Casablanca zone; without this patch, zic
    would generate an incorrect year-2440 transition for the zone,
    where 2440 = 2037 + 400 + 3.

    One line per metadatum in tzdata.zi
    
    With the new metadata, version lines could be long.  E.g., 'make
    DATAFORM=rearguard REDO=posix_only PACKRATDATA=backzone BACKWARD='
    could generate a tzdata.zi line like this:
      # version 2018e-57-gba7f088,dataform=rearguard,redo=posix_only,ddeps=(backzone,!backward)
    which is quite a mouthful and is stretching the definition of
    "version".  To avoid the problem, output a separate comment line
    for each metadata component instead, like this:
      # version 2018e-57-gba7f088
      # dataform rearguard
      # redo posix_only
      # ddeps backzone !backward
    This is easier to read and to parse and should scale better
    if we add more metadata later.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * zishrink.awk: Output a separate line for each metadatum.
    
    2018-07-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
    
    Use space, not comma, in tzdata.zi "# version"
    * zishrink.awk: Use space instead of comma to separate original
    version string from auxiliary configuration information.  This
    saves two bytes and (more important) is easier for humans to read.

    Inspired by a remark by Brian Inglis, who suggested REDO in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-July/026664.html
    This doesn't do the other things he mentioned, as they are
    not supported by our Makefile; if a downstream distributor
    implements those other things, the distributor should append
    a downstream-specific suffix to the 'version' string.

    Use “timezone“ for timestamp histories
    
    The POSIX standard uses the spelling “timezone”, and often uses it to
    mean a TZ setting that determines the past and predicted future of UT
    offsets, time zone abbreviations, and tm_isdst flags.  In contrast, in
    popular usage by far the most common spelling is “time zone”, and it
    typically means a maximal geographic region of clocks that currently
    have the same standard time.  As these two quite-different meanings
    are often confused, attempt to disambiguate things a bit by
    consistently using “timezone” for the former meaning and “time zone”
    for the latter.  This affects documentation and a few diagnostic
    messages.

    Remove Big Bang hack
    
    The Big Bang hack introduced in 2013d should no longer be needed,
    now that type 0 is the default type and types are reordered to
    make this happen.  I.e., since we now have a better fix for the
    Macquarie Island problem reported by Alan Gutierrez in
    <https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-May/019368.html>,
    we can revert much of the 2013-05-23 12:19:13 -0700 change “Rework
    to avoid problem with Australia/Macquarie on 32-bit hosts” and the
    2014-05-01 16:32:16 -0700 followup change “zic: improve handling
    of low-valued time stamps” which caused zic to insert a dummy
    transition.  As a result, zic now generates TZif files that are
    typically a few bytes shorter, as they were in 2013c and earlier.
    * Makefile, zic.8: Remove mention of Big Bang.

    with the last transition’s time type, it will become more
    important if we stop requiring at least one time type in the
    binary data, as the TZ string will then be the only source for
    time types.

    Use type 0 for timestamps before first transition
    
    I ran into this problem when helping to draft:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-murchison-tzdist-tzif-04
    Its section 3.2 gives a complex four-step procedure for
    determining the type of timestamps before the first transition,
    derived from 2018e localtime.c.  However, I just now checked, and
    glibc does only the last two steps.  Furthermore, in practice
    nowadays only the last step is needed in almost all zones, because
    type 0 is almost always the right type to use; the only exceptions
    are the legacy zones EST5EDT, CST6CDT, MST7MDT, PST8PDT, CET, MET,
    and EET.  As the tzif-04 section 3.2 procedure is only for
    backward compatibility with older TZif files, now is a good time
    to clean up by specifying a simple way to deal with time stamps
    before the first transition, namely, to use time type 0.
    So, this patch changes zic so that the first-used standard time type
    (if there is one) is always time type 0.  This is compatible with
    glibc and with any other program that uses the heuristic of using
    the lowest-numbered standard-time time type for timestamps before
    the first transition, since it merely changes zic to output
    a standard-time type 0.
    * NEWS, tzfile.5: Document this.
    * localtime.c (tzparse): Make standard time type 0, if standard
    time is in use.  This should help future-proof this program
    if we ever get rid of the defaulttype member and just use 0.
    * zic.c (swaptypes): New function.
    (writezone): Reorder types to make type 0 the default type.
    Negate the local variable writetypes into omittypes, so that
    strlen can be used on it, and enlarge it by 1 to make room for a
    sentinel.  Use memset where appropriate.

    * africa (Ghana): Add commentary about what little is known about
    time near Accra from 1919 through 1942.  Every source seems to
    differ.  For now, leave the data alone.  It would be nice if
    someone could get to the bottom of this.

    ENOTSUP, create the parent directory of the destination anyway,
    since it is needed before the later call to fopen.

    Standardize better on “daylight saving time”
    
    In the text we write, prefer the phrase “daylight saving time” to
    alternatives like “summer time”.  This better matches the name
    ‘tm_isdst’ used in C.  Daylight saving time need not occur in
    summer, and need not have a positive offset from standard time.

    Problem reported by Jon Skeet in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2017-October/025362.html
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * zdump.c (my_snprintf): New macro or function.  If a macro, it is
    just snprintf.  If a function, it is the same as the old snprintf
    static function, with an ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT to pacify modern GCC.
    All uses of snprintf changed to use my_snprintf.  This way,
    installers don’t need to specify -DHAVE_SNPRINTF if they are using
    a pre-C99 compiler with a library that has snprintf.

    * Makefile, NEWS, Theory: Document this.

    private.h declares tzname as needed now.
    * localtime.c (tzname, timezone, daylight, altzone): Also
    define if TZ_TIME_T.  However, define only if the relevant
    other macro (HAVE_TZNAME, USG_COMPAT, ALTZONE) is set or defined.
    (update_tzname_etc, settzname): Set tzname only if HAVE_TZNAME.
    At the end, simplify ifdef by using TZ_TIME_T.
    * newctime.3: Document optional vars and fields more carefully.
    * private.h (USG_COMPAT): Set default from _XOPEN_VERSION.
    All uses changed to assume it is 1 or 0.
    (HAVE_TZNAME): Set default from that and from _POSIX_VERSION.
    (TZ_TIME_T): New macro.
    (daylight, timezone, tzname, altzone): Rename if needed to avoid
    collision with standard library.
    (tzname): Declare if (!HAVE_POSIX_DECLS || TZ_TIME_T) && HAVE_TZNAME.

    Without this change, tzdata source's 669742 bytes (180832 bytes
    compressed) shrank to tzdata.zi's 123627 bytes (22247 bytes compressed).
    With this change, tzdata.zi is 106273 bytes (21203 bytes compressed).
    That is, the change's data compression ratio is about 1.16 (1.05 for
    compressed data), and the total data compression ratio of tzdata.zi is
    now about 6.3 (8.5 for compressed data).  These figures assume
    lzip -9 compression.

    Remove unnecessary code for DOS file names in zic
    
    * Makefile: Adjust comment accordingly.
    * zic.c (mkdirs) [HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES]: Do not treat drive letters
    specially.  Time zone names follow Unix convention, and drive
    letters have no special meaning.  In other words, treat drive
    letters consistently with backslashes, which also do not have a
    special meaning here.  If the -d argument of zic does not name an
    already-existing directory, it should use slashes to separate the
    already-existing ancestor prefix from the to-be-created
    subdirectories.

    zic: some integer-width fixups
    
    Removes some arbitrary INT_MAX limits for things like zone counts.
    Use PTRDIFF_MAX instead.  This is mostly just a theoretical
    cleanup, as zic is not used with more than INT_MAX zones in practice.
    * private.h (PRIdFAST64): New macro, if not already defined.
    (SCNdFAST64): Use it.
    (time_t_min, time_t_max): Don't assume no padding bits, if
    C11 and time_t is one of the standard signed integer types.
    * zic.c: Include stddef.h, for ptrdiff_t.
    Use ptrdiff_t, not int, for object counts when the code does
    not place other limitations on the counts.
    (PRIdZIC, PRIdLINENO): New macros.
    (lineno): New typedef.  Use it instead of int for input line numbers.
    (struct rule.r_todo): Now bool instead of int.
    (componentcheck, infile, rulesub): Avoid cast to int.
    (writezone): Use a different warning when outputting more
    transition times than reference clients can handle.  Report an
    error in the unlikely case where the number of transition times
    exceeds what tzfile(5) allows.  Use int not char for thischarcnt,
    as that avoids a cast.
    (shellquote): New function.
    (yearistype): Use it, to fix problems with strings containing
    shell metacharacters.  Don't limit years to INT_MAX.  Use
    free+malloc rather than realloc, since there is no need to save
    the old contents.  Stop worrying about warnings from compilers
    that don't grok _Noreturn.
    (getfields): Use EXIT_FAILURE instead of 1.

    Make targets more atomically
    
    A 'make' that failed due to a write failure could leave behind a
    junk file that was up-to-date, confusing a later 'make'.
    * Makefile (version, version.h, leapseconds, zones, tzselect)
    ($(MANTXTS), tzcode$(VERSION).tar.gz, tzdata$(VERSION).tar.gz)

    Port better to Solaris 10
    
    Solaris 10 /bin/sh does not handle exit status properly when
    called from 'make', and does not support the $(...) syntax.
    Also, simplify by removing comments about Solaris 9 and earlier,
    which are no longer maintained.
    * Makefile: Update comments for current operating system status.
    (version, set-timestamps.out):
    Don’t fail on Solaris 10 merely because git is not installed.
    (version, version.h, $(TZS_NEW), tzselect, check_white_space)
    (set-timestamps.out, check_time_t_alternatives, tarballs)
    (traditional_tarballs, signatures, traditional_signatures)
    (tzdb-$(VERSION).tar.lz):
    Use `foo`, not $(foo), for Solaris 10 /bin/sh.
    Check for command failure the old-fashioned way.
    * private.h, zdump.c (HAVE_STDINT_H):
    Default to 1 if limits.h defines INTMAX_MAX, for Solaris 10.
    * strftime.c (_fmt): Rework to avoid diagnostic about unreachable
    code from Sun C 5.9.  Remove unwanted test for tm_isdst in the
    case where TM_GMTOFF is defined.

    The main reason for this is to simplify debugging.
    It also improves performance slightly, I suppose.
    * NEWS: Document this.
    * zic.c (close_file): New arg DIR.  All callers changed.
    (change_directory): New function.
    (relname): Remove.
    (dolink, writezone): Simplify by assuming chdir.
    (itsdir) [!S_ISDIR]: Append "." by hand.

    not modified.  New arg ANCESTORS.  Return void, not bool.  All

    zic is now more careful about symlinks
    
    This avoids some problems in creating nonworking hard links to
    symlinks, as well as removing the need for some stat calls.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * zic.c (lstat, S_ISLNK) [!HAVE_SYMLINK]: New fallback macros.
    (dolink): Remove destination before linking; this is more consistent
    with what is done with fopen, and simplifies the code.  It also lets
    us avoid some mkdir calls in some cases.
    (itsdir): Document that errno is set when -1 is returned.
    Use lstat, not stat.  Avoid tricky code with EOVERFLOW, as it doesn't
    work with lstat and probably wasn't worth the trouble anyway.
    (writezone): Do not bother statting the destination before removing
    it.  The old code catered to ancient platforms that lacked the
    'remove' function and where trouble could ensue if a program unlinked
    a directory.  We don't need to worry about these platforms any more,
    as the code has been successfully using 'remove' since the 1980s.
    (mkdirs): Exit on failure, and return true if some directories are made.
    All callers changed.  Allow symlinks as well as directories.

    Fix tzname redefinition in MS-Windows
    
    Problem reported by Ian Abbott in:
    http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2016-February/023289.html
    * localtime.c (tzname): Don’t define if HAVE_POSIX_DECLS,
    as causes the Microsoft compiler to complain that tzname
    is redeclared without dllimport.
    * localtime.c, private.h (altzone): Do define even if
    HAVE_POSIX_DECLS, since this is not a POSIX-specified variable.

    * zdump.c (environ, getopt, optarg, optind, tzname):
    * zic.c (getopt, link, optarg, optind):
    Do not declare if HAVE_POSIX_DECLS, to avoid collisions with
    system declarations, which is a problem with MS-Windows
    and tzname and the dllimport attribute.
    * date.c, zdump.c (tzname): Do not specify size, as POSIX doesn’t.
    * private.h (HAVE_POSIX_DECLS): Default to 1.
    (ENOTSUP): Default to EINVAL.
    * zic.c: If HAVE_DIRECT_H, include direct.h and io.h and
    define a mkdir macro, for MS-Windows.
    (link, symlink): Set errno to ENOTSUP in the substitutes.
    (dolink): Don’t complain merely because link and/or
    symlink is not supported.  Be a bit more economical and robust
    about checking for directories and existing destinations.
    Report errno-related string on link failures.
    (itsdir): Work correctly even if a directory has a timestamp that
    is out of time_t range, so that stat fails with errno ==
    EOVERFLOW.
    (writezone): Don’t remove files we can’t stat.

    * localtime.c (tzloadbody): When on a host with signed 32-bit
    time_t, don't skip reading the 64-bit tables, as skipping caused

    recent changes for Fiji, there is a transition from +1300 to +1200
    at 2018-01-17 03:00 local time.  Since this transition is after
    2037, zic omits the explicit transition, which must be calculated
    from the POSIX-TZ-style string "FJT-12FJST,M11.1.0,M1.3.0/3" at
    the end of the file.  If the code skips reading the 64-bit tables,
    it doesn't get to the proper position to see the POSIX-TZ-style
    string.

    Support %z in Zone formats
    
    This extends the zic input format to add support for %z, which
    expands to a UTC offset in as-short-as-possible ISO 8601 format.
    It's intended to better support zones that do not have an
    established abbreviation already.  This is a change only to zic;
    it does not affect the data, which can still be compiled with
    older zic versions.
    * NEWS, zic.8: Document this.
    * zic.c (struct zone): New member z_format_specifier.
    (PERCENT_Z_LEN_BOUND): New constant.
    (max_abbrvar_len): Initialize to it, rather than to 0.
    (associate, inzsub, doabbr): Add support for %z.
    (abbroffset): New function.
    (doabbr): 2nd arg is now struct zone *, not a char *.
    All callers changed.

    Propagate Chile changes to Antarctica/Palmer
    
    When recently changing the 'Chile' ruleset in 'southamerica', I
    forgot to update its copy 'ChileAQ' in 'antarctica'.  This sort of
    thing has been a continuing problem over the years.  Attempt to
    make further recurrences less likely by moving 'Antarctica/Palmer'
    from 'antarctica' to 'southamerica', so that there's no need to
    copy the rules in question.
    * antarctica (ArgAQ, ChileAQ): Remove.
    (Antarctica/Palmer): Move to ...
    * southamerica: ... this file, and use plain 'Arg' and 'Chile'.

    Fix localtime.c undefined behaviors and set errno.
    
    Christos Zoulas reported a crash due to a tzsetlcl failure to
    initialize data in some places, and requested that errno be set
    when time functions fail; see:
    http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021754.html
    While fixing this in a different way, I noticed and fixed another
    instance of undefined behavior when read returns a too-small value.
    * NEWS: Document this.
    * localtime.c (union input_buffer): Rename from u_t.
    (union input_buffer, union local_storage):
    Move to top level so that two functions can use them.
    (tzloadbody): New function, with most of the body of the old tzload.
    Check for short reads that leave uninitialized buffers behind.
    Define a new constant TZHEADSIZE for this, and use it to simplify
    other code that already uses the concept.
    (tzload): Use it.  This removes the need for gotos.  Return an errno
    value; all callers changed.
    (zoneinit): Return bool, not struct state *.  Assume SP is nonnull.
    All callers changed.
    (zoneinit, tzalloc): Set errno on failure.
    (tzsetlcl): Don't crash if zoneinit fails.
    * private.h (ENAMETOOLONG): Define if not already defined.

    Fix EOVERFLOW-related problems noted by Chistos Zoulas.
    
    See: http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021692.html
    * asctime.c (asctime_r): Remove now-unnecessary EOVERFLOW ifdef.
    * localtime.c (timesub): Set errno to EOVERFLOW on overflow.
    POSIX requires this.
    (ctime, ctime_r): Return NULL instead of having undefined behavior
    when the time stamp is out of struct tm range.  NetBSD does this,
    the standards allow it, and it's nicer for users.
    * private.h (EOVERFLOW): Default to EINVAL on ancient hosts that lack it.

    Fix some localtime.c problems noted by Christos Zoulas
    
    in: http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021684.html
    * localtime.c (tzload): Use ssize_t, not int.  Redo comparison to
    avoid the need for an ssize_t value less than -1, which POSIX does
    not guarantee.  Use memmove so that we needn't worry about an
    ssize_t index.
    (tzparse): Remove static always-zero var.  Initialized fields
    to zero by hand instead.
    (zoneinit): Initialized more fields, to avoid undefined behavior
    in tzalloc.
    (leapcorr): Fix bug, a stray initialization of a local variable.
    * Makefile: Add comment about ssize_t.
    * NEWS: Document the above.

    Make 'timezone' and 'altzone' more compatible with 'tzname'.
    
    * localtime.c (localsub): Don't bother updating 'tzname' again
    when localtime is GMT, as tzset's value should be fine.  When
    updating 'tzname', also update 'timezone' and 'altzone'
    consistently, on platforms that define the latter two vars.

    This may be significantly slower, but it's safer.

    Problem reported by Tim Parenti in:
    http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-September/021585.html
    * zdump.c (localtime_r, localtime_rz) [!TM_ZONE]:
    Just call 'localtime', since this can set tzname in a
    timestamp-dependent way, which is better for zdump.
    * NEWS: Document this.

commit 9618efb826ed5a1efae98a6852f8a187791ea8f2
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Sep 10 23:21:45 2014 -0700

    Fix 2014g regression: localtime and mktime weren't setting tzname.
    
    In 2014g, localtime and mktime set tzname[0] and tzname[1] as if by
    tzset, regardless of the requested time stamp.  In 2014f and earlier,
    localtime and mktime then set tzname[0] or tzname[1] to a time zone
    appropriate for the time stamp in question.
    Although both behaviors conform to POSIX, the 2014f behavior is
    better because it lets a single-threaded application discover the
    time zone abbreviation appropriate for the just-queried time stamp
    even on platforms that lack TM_ZONE.  The 2014f-and-earlier zdump
    relies on the 2014f library behavior on these platforms.
    Problem reported by Tim Parenti in:
    http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-September/021585.html
    * localtime.c (localsub): Treat a nonzero offset value
    as a request to set tzname on success.  All callers changed.
    (localtime_rz, mktime_z): Define only if NETBSD_INSPIRED,
    as they're no longer needed otherwise.
    (localtime_tzset): Invert sense of third arg from SKIP_TZSET
    to SETTZ.  New arg SETNAME.  All callers changed.
    (localtime): Request tzname to be set on success.

    Port C macro defaults to Solaris and Irix.
    
    This is mostly for convenience, so that plain 'make' works out of
    the box on Solaris, instead of having to run something awkward like
    'make CFLAGS="-xc99=all -DHAVE_INCOMPATIBLE_CTIME_R=1"', and
    similarly for Irix 6.5.
    * private.h (_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS):

    New macros, to make Solaris headers more like what we want out
    of the box.
    (LLONG_MAX, LLONG_MIN): Default from __LONG_LONG_MAX__ if it's defined.
    This simplifies later code.
    (SCNdFAST64, PRIdMAX): Don't assume they're defined when
    INT_FAST64_MAX is, as that's not true on Solaris 10 + Sun C 5.12.
    (PRIuMAX): Likewise, for Solaris 11 + Sun C 5.12.

    If the UTC offset doesn't match the request, try the requested offset.
    This catches a problem caught by -DTYPECHECK with a time stamp
    near a transition from LMT to standard time, where both sides of
    the transition have tm_isdst == 0.  If !defined TM_GMTOFF ||
    UNINIT_TRAP you're out of luck: mktime will still conform

    Avoid (void) before calls.
    
    Although the cast to void in usage like '(void) printf ("Hello")'
    may have been helpful decades ago when Lint Was Your Friend,
    nowadays such casts are not helpful.  The tz code is currently not
    consistent about this: sometimes the casts are present, and
    sometimes absent.  As they make the code harder to read, let's
    remove them.
    * asctime.c, date.c, ialloc.c, localtime.c, strftime.c, zdump.c, zic.c:
    Don't cast calls to 'void'.

    (localsub): Don't set tzname here; that's not thread-safe.
    This change can lose information on hosts without TM_ZONE,
    but there is no reliable way to fix that in a thread-safe way.
    (localtime_tzset): New function, which does proper locking.

    tzselect: improve heuristic in Africa
    
    Add the product of the longitude difference and the cosine of the
    latitude farther from the equator to the distance measure.  This
    works better for the Congolese test case noted by Alan Barrett in:
    http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-July/021229.html
    The new heuristic is not perfect, but no heuristic is.

    Fix glitches with '-' and italics in man pages.
    
    Using '\-' to denote ASCII minus has problems in groff output, since
    it generates a minus sign in the current font, and if you cut and
    paste from the documentation the resulting text won't work.  To avoid
    the problem, define a string \*- that expands to ASCII minus in a
    constant-width font in groff.  Also, change some instances of \(mi and
    \(pl to use plain \- and +, since we no longer need special fonts for
    these.  Finally, remove some no-longer-needed instances of "\^" after
    italicized words.

    Switch back to ASCII for symbols.
    
    Garrett Wollman reported privately that XEmacs 21.4.22, the current
    stable version, doesn't work with the UTF-8 recently introduced
    into our commentary.  For example, the UTF-8 character '−'
    (MINUS SIGN), which is stored as the three bytes "\342\210\222",
    displays as 'â\210\222'.  For proper names this is annoying but
    tolerable, as there's little loss in utility from (say) 'Racoviță'
    to its display form 'RacoviÈ\233Ä\203'.  But for symbols this is a
    real pain that can make it hard to understand the documentation, e.g.,
    'Release 2014e – 2014-06-12 21:53:52 −0700' displays as
    'Release 2014e â\200\223 2014-06-12 21:53:52 â\210\2220700'.
    To work around this problem, make the following substitutions in
    commentary to mostly revert these symbols to their pre-UTF-8 versions:
    '§' -> 'section', '°' -> 'degrees', '±' -> '+-', '–' -> '-' (en
    dash), '—' -> '--' (em dash), '′' -> "'", '″' -> '"', '→' -> '->',
    '−' -> '-' (minus sign), '≤' -> '<='.  Leave proper names and
    foreign words in UTF-8.

    Update to pacify recent GCC's static checking.
    
    These changes pacify gcc 4.8.2-19ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 14.04,
    and take advantage of recently-added GCC options when compiling
    with GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS.
    * Makefile (GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS): Add -Wdeclaration-after-statement,
    -Wjump-misses-init, -Wsuggest-attribute=format.
    * date.c (copyright, sccsid):
    * strftime.c (sccsid):
    Remove unused vars.
    * date.c (main):
    * localtime.c (tzparse):
    Remove no-longer-needed uses of INITIALIZE; GCC is smart enough to
    figure these out on its own now.
    * localtime.c (gmtsub): Redo initialization of gmt_is_set to pacify GCC.
    Retry malloc next time even if it failed this time.
    * private.h, zdump.c (GNUC_or_lint): Remove, as it provoked a GCC
    diagnostic about unused macros in some cases.  Instead, just use
    'lint'.  All uses removed.
    (TZ_DOMAIN): Don't define unless needed, as otherwise it provokes
    a GCC diagnostic about unused macros.
    * private.h (INITIALIZE): Simplify accordingly.
    * NEWS: Document this.

    Distinguish hyphen from minus from dashes.
    
    Most of this patch is to commentary, to distinguish better among
    the similar characters hyphen '-', minus sign '−', en dash '–' (used
    for ranges), and em dash '—'.  Render ordinary dashes in text as
    spaced en dashes, as this gives better-looking results in monospaced
    fonts.
    * yearistype.sh, zic.c: Reword diagnostics so that they do not use
    hyphens as if they were dashes.  Since we are sticking to ASCII in
    programs, we can't use proper dashes in diagnostics.

    Simplify use of URLs in text files.
    
    In several cases our text files had commentary like this:
    # Egypt to cancel daylight saving time
    # <a href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/407168">
    # http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/407168
    # </a>
    where lines 2 and 4 let the file be viewed by a browser with the
    URL being clickable.  In practice this approach does not work with
    many modern browsers (I tested with Firefox and with Chrome) and
    it clutters up the data, so in cases like the above this patch
    removes lines 2 and 4.

    Don't abuse "`" to mean open quote.
    
    This was appropriate before Unicode, where "`" and "'" often balanced
    in visual output, but that's been obsolete for a while.
    Overall, single-quote 'like this' instead of `like this', and
    double-quote "like this" or (in typeset output) “like this”
    instead of ``like this''.  While we're at it, fix some glitches
    with hyphens versus minus versus en dash versus em dash.
    * Makefile ($(MANTXTS)): Use UTF-8 locale to produce *.txt output.
    * checktab.awk, tzselect.ksh:

    zic: work around GNOME bug by refusing to go back before the Big Bang
    
    This works around Gnome bug 730332
    <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730332>.
    zic 2014c introduced the idea of generating a transition at the
    minimum time value -2**63, to avoid ambiguities about what to do
    before the first real transition.  Through Glib release 2.40, the
    interval_end function of Glib's gtimezone.c subtracts one from
    this, to find the end time of the zeroth interval (i.e., the
    interval containing all the "early" time stamps); this subtraction
    typically overflows and wraps around to 2**63 - 1, which causes
    Glib to go off the rails and assume that all time stamps are
    "early".  For example, Glib computes Sao Paulo time stamps as if
    Brazil's circa-1913 rules were still in effect.
    (Thanks to Leonardo Chiquitto for reporting the bug.)
    Work around the bug by not generating time stamps equal to -2**63.
    Come to think of it, time stamps before the Big Bang are physically
    suspect anyway, so don't generate time stamps before the Big Bang.

    localtime: fix overflow bugs for 32-bit unsigned time_t
    
    This fixes a longstanding test-case failure with
    'make check_time_t_alternatives'.
    * localtime.c (detzcode64): Return int_fast64_t, not time_t,
    for the benefit of platforms where time_t is narrower than 64 bits.
    The distinction matters if time_t is 32-bit unsigned.
    Simplify the shifts and masks.
    (tzload): Fix the check for overflow when storing the loaded time
    value into a time_t object.  The old code didn't work when
    time_t was an unsigned 32-bit quantity.
    (transtime): Return the offset from the start of the year,
    not the offset since the Epoch, since the former cannot overflow
    but the latter can.  Caller changed.
    (tzparse): Check for overflow more carefully when computing
    time stamps.  The old code didn't work for 32-bit unsigned values,
    in unusual situations such as Pacific/Fiji and Pacific/Auckland
    for times past 2038.
    (increment_overflow_time): New function.

    * zdump.c (strtoimax) [!INTMAX_MAX]: Define like private.h does.
    (SCNdMAX): Remove; no longer used.
    (main): Use strtoimax, not sscanf with SCNdMAX, as strtoimax has
    well-defined behavior when the input number is out of numeric range.

    tzselect: work around an old BusyBox awk bug
    
    Patch by Patrick 'P. J.' McDermott in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-October/020444.html>.
    * tzselect.ksh: Replace awk -F options with FS assignments.
    Before version 1.21.0, BusyBox awk didn't unescape the argument to
    the -F option.  As a result, tzselect couldn't parse tables with
    such versions of BusyBox awk.  See
    <https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=5126> and
    <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit?id=ea664dd>.

    This code is quite a bit different from what he proposed.
    * tzselect.ksh: Rewrite so that it should work with /bin/sh on
    common platforms.  For portability to Solaris 9 /bin/sh, use
    `...`, not $(...), and avoid $((...)).
    (doselect): New function.  Use this instead of plain 'select'.

    build: Makefile fixes; let user give AR and RANLIB; local libtz.a
    
    * Makefile: Let the user override AR, and build libtz.a before
    installing it, as suggested by Michael Forney in
    <https://github.com/eggert/tz/pull/3>.  Also, let the user
    override RANLIB.  Modernize a bit by assuming POSIX.2-1992 or
    later; this is safe nowadays and simplifies the libtz.a business.
    And treat 'leapseconds' more like we used to, since it's
    machine-independent a 'make clean' doesn't need to remove it.
    (TZLIB): Remove.
    (AR, RANLIB): New macros.
    (TABDATA): Add leapseconds, so that 'make' builds it by default.
    (DATA): Remove leapseconds, since $(TABDATA) now has it.
    (all): Depend on libtz.a, not $(LIBOBJS).
    (install): Install libtz.a using 'cp', like other files.
    Also invoke $(RANLIB) on it, after installing.
    Do not assume that TZDIR is not overridden.
    (install, INSTALL, check_time_t_alternatives): Use 'mkdir -p', as
    it's safe to assume nowadays (standardized in POSIX.2-1992).
    (install, INSTALL): Prefer 'cp -f' to 'rm' followed by 'cp', as
    it's safe to assume 'cp -f' nowadays (also standardized in POSIX.2-1992).
    (libtz.a): Rename from $(DESTDIR)$(TZLIB), since we now build it here.
    Use $(AR) rather than ar.
    Use $(RANLIB) rather than trying to guess it.
    (clean_misc): Do not remove 'leapseconds', as it's machine-independent.
    (maintainer-clean): Remove 'leapseconds' here instead.
    (clean, check_public): Standardize on 'rm -fr' rather than 'rm -f -r';
    formerly the makefile was inconsistent.
    (set-timestamps.out): Don't ignore failurs of the actual touch command.

    This doesn't affect zic's binary output; it affects only the

    build: port to MinGW and fix symlink bugs
    
    MinGW problem reported by Theo Veenker in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-September/020378.html>.
    The patched code should work even on POSIXish hosts
    where 'link' and 'symlink' fail for whatever reason,
    e.g., if the destination file system is VFAT.
    Also, the patch fixes some bugs when symlinks are used.
    * Makefile (CFLAGS): Mention HAVE_LINK in the comment.
    (TZDSRCS): Add asctime.o, since MinGW lacks asctime.
    (TZDOBJS): Add asctime.c.
    * private.h (HAVE_LINK): Default to 1.
    * zic.c (link) [!HAVE_LINK]: New macro.
    (symlink) [!HAVE_SYMLINK]: New macro.
    (dolink): Fix some bugs when 'link' fails but 'symlink' succeeds.
    Fall back on copying when both fail.

    Problem with leapseconds reported by Matt Burgess in

    with a followup by Ian Abbott in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-September/020383.html>.
    * Makefile (MANTXTS): New macro.
    (maintainer-clean): Use it.
    (DOCS): Add it.
    (DATA): Add 'leapseconds'.
    (LEAP_DEPS): New macro.
    (leapseconds): Use it.
    (public): Don't depend on set-timestamps; each tarball does that
    individually now, to allow for more parallelization.
    (date.1.txt, newctime.3.txt, newstrftime.3.txt, newtzset.3.txt)
    (time2posix.3.txt, tzfile.5.txt, tzselect.8.txt, zdump.8.txt)
    (zic.8.txt): Depend on the corresponding non-.txt file.
    $(MANTXTS): New rule.
    (set-timestamps.out): Rename from set-timestamps, and make it a file,
    so that it has its own timestamp; this avoids useless rework.
    Depend on $(ENCHILADA) and ignore files under Git that are not
    also listed in $(ENCHILADA).  Set the timestamp of 'leapseconds'
    and each $(MANTXTS) to be the maximum of its dependencies, to avoid
    timestamp churn in future tarballs.  Prefer touch -m, as we don't
    care about access time here.
    (tzcode$(VERSION).tar.gz, tzdata$(VERSION).tar.gz):
    Depend on set-timestamps.out rather than the individual files,
    so timestamps are set before creating the tarballs even when
    make is parallelized.
    (tzcode$(VERSION).tar.gz): Don't mention *.[1-8].txt explicitly,
    since we now get $(MANTXTS) via $(DOCS).

    Improve the support for perpetual DST.
    
    Problem reported by Zefram in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-September/020059.html>.
    * localtime.c (tzparse): Elide simultaneous entries out of and
    into DST if DST goes for an hour more than a year (actually, for
    more than the DST offset more than a year).  Since this
    optimization can elide all entries, avoid looping forever looking
    for entries that will never arrive.  While we're at it, fix
    another portability bug where the code assumed wraparound on
    signed integer overflow.
    * newtzset.3, tzfile.5: Mention that as an extension to POSIX,
    if DST covers the entire year plus the DST offset, it's assumed to
    be in effect all year.  Give an example.
    * zic.c (stringrule): Omit the "J" in January and February,
    as this can save a byte or two in the output.
    (rule_cmp): New function.
    (stringzone): Do a better job of constructing the standard-time
    abbreviation when there is perpetual DST.  Defer to the new
    stringrule to construct the times for perpetual DST.
    Fix bug noted by Zefram, which caused a stray hour of standard
    time to be inserted in an otherwise perpetual DST.
    Previously, this code generated "WARST4WARST,J1/0,J365/24"
    for the San Luis example; now it generates "WART4WARST,0/0,J365/25".

    Support time stamps past 2038 in zones like America/Santiago.
    
    This implements a suggestion by Arthur David Olson.
    Without this change, zic -v diagnoses problems with several zones
    where it cannot compute a POSIX-equivalent TZ setting for time
    stamps past 2038, which means these time stamps may be mishandled.
    This entails a minor change to the binary tz file format, to allow
    a minor extension to the POSIX TZ setting in the binary file,
    instead of requiring a pure POSIX TZ setting.  The zones fixed by
    this change are America/Godthab, America/Santiago, Antarctica/Palmer,
    Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron, Asia/Jerusalem, Pacific/Easter, and
    Pacific/Fiji.  The only zone that remains unfixed is
    Asia/Tehran, which schedules clock transitions via the
    Iranian calendar, something that even the extended TZ
    setting cannot represent.
    * localtime.c (getrule): Allow transition times to be signed.
    * newtzset.3: Describe the extensions to POSIX TZ strings.
    Some of these extensions (e.g., hours == 26) were already
    implemented but were not documented.  Give examples.
    * tzfile.5: Document the relaxed restriction on the stored TZ
    string; its hours component can be in the range -167..167 rather
    than the POSIX-required 0..24.  Refer to newtzset(5).
    * zic.c (stringoffset): Allow hours to go up to 167.
    (stringrule): Be willing to generate hours in the range -167
    through 167.

    Correct some UTC-vs-UT solecisms.
    
    In several places the code and documentation incorrectly used
    "UTC" to describe time stamps that might precede the introduction
    of UTC and for which UTC is therefore undefined.  Change these
    uses to "UT", as that's the correct term when talking about these
    time stamps.  Problem reported by Steve Allen in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-September/019907.html>.
    The major compatibility issue here is with 'zdump -v'; it'll now
    output "UT" instead of the possibly-incorrect "UTC".
    Many files change in minor ways in the commentary.
    * zdump.c (show):
    * zic.c (inzsub, addtype):
    In output, say "UT" rather than "UTC", since the time stamp we're

    Link to America/Port_of_Spain instead of having a separate zone
    that differs only in LMT.  Each LMT entry is just a placeholder for
    unavailable info, and by itself does not justify a separate zone.
    Using just one zone simplifies maintenance, makes the runtime
    a bit smaller, and can help simplify user selection of zones.
    * southamerica (America/Aruba): Likewise, for America/Curacao.

    Revert recent pre-1970 changes.
    
    Other tz file readers had problems with the new pre1970 file, so
    remove it and related changes.  To recover the pre-1970 data,
    instead change pre-1970 Zone entries in other files back to what
    they were.  Perhaps we'll try to find a better way someday.
    * .gitignore: Remove back-pre1970.
    * Makefile (BACKWARD): Remove.  All uses changed back to 'backward'.

    New file 'pre1970' for zones that differ only in pre-1970 time stamps.
    
    This lets us preserve information about pre-1970 time stamps when
    we change a Zone to a Link to another zone whose time stamps agree
    after 1970.  This should address concerns about some recent
    changes that removed this information.  This implementation is a
    stripped-down version of a suggestion by Andrew Main (Zefram) in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-August/019615.html> and
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-August/019639.html> to
    allow filtering tz data by date range.  Unlike Zefram's
    suggestion, this implementation supports only two date ranges,
    namely 1970 on, using 'make BACKWARD=backward'; and all dates,
    using 'make BACKWARD="pre1970 back-pre1970"'.  At some point I'd
    like to improve it to support arbitrary date ranges, but at least
    we've now restored the data whose loss was of some concern.
    * .gitignore: Add back-pre1970.
    * Makefile (BACKWARD): New macro.
    (YDATA): Use it instead of 'backward'.
    (AWK_SCRIPTS): New macro, with additional script back-pre1970.awk.
    (MISC): Use it.
    (back-pre1970): New rule.
    (clean_misc): Clean back-pre1970.  Also clean time.tab, while we're
    at it.
    (check_public): Don't require pre1970 to stand alone.
    * pre1970, back-pre1970.awk: New files.

    This is like the previous change, except it entails a change to zone.tab.
    The America/Montreal entry was created only because we mistakenly
    thought that Montreal's and Toronto's post-1970 time stamps differed.
    * backward, northamerica (America/Montreal):
    Now a 'backward' link to America/Toronto.
    * northamerica (Mont): Remove rules; no longer needed.
    (America/Thunder_Bay): Refer to Toronto rules, not Mont.
    This doesn't change any time stamps.
    * zone.tab (America/Montreal): Remove.

    This continues in the series of moving entries to 'backward' if
    they exist only because of obsolete tz rules about country codes.
    In this case, Zone entries are changed to Links; this doesn't
    affect any post-1970 time stamps, and the pre-1970 time stamps
    are out of scope and are often of dubious reliability.

    Add -t ZONETABTYPE option to 'tzselect'.
    
    This is a backwards-compatible way of transitioning to a less
    politically-charged approach to choosing TZ values.  A new time
    zone table time.tab acts like zone.tab, except it omits TZ values
    that are present only for political reasons.  tzselect has a new
    "-t zonetabtype" option that lets users select which time zone table
    to use, and installers can select the default table.  The zone.tab
    file does not change, and the default tzselect table for now is
    zone.tab.  This avoids the backward-compatibility concerns
    expressed on the tz mailing list; see, for example,
    the discussion surrounding Derick Rethans's comments in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-August/019544.html>

    * zone-time.awk: New file.

    * tzselect.ksh (ZONETABTYPE): New var.
    Implement -t ZONETABTYPE option.
    Check that no extra operands are given.

    Move McMurdo and South Pole to 'backward'.
    
    This continues in the series of moving entries to 'backward' if
    they exist only because of obsolete tz rules about country codes.
    This change does not affect any time stamps after 1970.  Unlike
    the previous change in this series, this one does affect time
    stamps before 1970, but that's OK as pre-1970 time stamps are
    out of scope for the tz database.
    * antarctica (Antarctica/McMurdo, Antarctica/South_Pole):
    Move to 'backward' and link to Pacific/Auckland.
    * backward: Move links here from 'antarctica'.
    * zone.tab: Coalesce McMurdo and South Pole, and add Scott Base
    to the description.

    Change Indonesian time zone names to reflect common practice.
    
    * asia (Asia/Dili, Asia/Jakarta, Asia/Pontianak, Asia/Makassar)
    (Asia/Jayapura): Use WIB/WITA/WIT rather than WIT/CIT/EIT, since
    it's typical to use Indonesian-language abbreviations even when
    writing in English.  I surveyed the Internet and Google Books and
    found several independent English-language sources using WIB/WITA/WIT,
    whereas it seemed only tz-inspired sources used WIT/CIT/EIT.
    Problem reported several times, by George Ziegler, Priyadi Iman

    see Lin's summary of the reports in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-February/018609.html>.
    This change does not affect time zone offsets, just alphabetic
    abbreviations, such as tm_zone in the BSD-style struct tm.
    (Asia/Jakarta): Use BMT, not JMT, for mean time from 1923 to 1932,
    as Jakarta was called Batavia back then.

    Move links to 'backward' if they exist only because of country codes.
    
    * backward: Move links here from other files, if the only reason
    they existed was to fill out zone.tab.  Zones are now allowed to
    cross national borders, so a zone now need not exist merely
    because there's a national border.  Sort the list consistently.
    None of this changes any time stamp in the database.

    duplicate column 1 or column 3.  For each link moved to 'backward',
    change column 3 to be the non-backward name.

    * private.h: Include float.h.
    (strtoimax): New macro, for pre-C99 systems that lack strtoimax.
    (time_t_min, time_t_max): New constants, from zdump, with

    Port to NetBSD, where, e.g., 'time_t' is wider than 'long'.
    
    I audited the code and fixed as many width-asssumptions as I could
    find, including several places where the code assumed that 'time_t'
    was no wider than 'long'; this assumption is not true on 32-bit
    NetBSD platforms.  This caught every problem that is already fixed
    in the NetBSD zic.c, and caught quite a few more.
    * Makefile: Add comments re HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES and HAVE_INTTYPES_H.
    * date.c (checkfinal, netsettime): Don't use 'long' where 'int' will do.
    * difftime.c (difftime): Mark with ATTRIBUTE_CONST.
    Use uintmax_t, not unsigned long, for the widest unsigned integer type.
    Use long double, not double, if time_t is wider than uintmax_t;
    this can in theory help on nonstandard platforms, such as GCC
    with 64-bit uintmax_t and 128-bit __int128_t.
    * localtime.c (struct ttinfo.tt_gmtoff, struct rule.r_time)
    (detzcode, getsecs, getoffset, gmtsub, localsub, increment_overflow32)
    (normalize_overflow32, time1, time2, timesub, transtime, tzparse)
    (time2sub, timeoff, gtime):
    * tzfile.h (SECSPERDAY):
    * zdump.c (SECSPERDAY):
    * zic.c (convert, puttzcode):
    Use int_fast32_t, not long, when all we care is that values up to
    2**31 can be stored.  This doesn't fix any bugs, but it allows
    more opportunity for compiler optimization.
    (struct lsinfo.ls_corr, timesub, leapcorr):
    Use int_fast64_t, not long, when values up to 2**63 can be stored.
    (timesub): Make it clearer when we are truncating 0.5 to 0.
    (increment_overflow32): Rename from long_increment_overflow.
    All uses changed.
    (normalize_overflow32): Rename from long_normalize_overflow.
    All uses changed.
    * private.h (HAVE_INTTYPES_H, ATTRIBUTE_CONST): New macros.
    Include <inttypes.h> if HAVE_INTTYPES_H.
    (INT_FAST64_MIN, INT_FAST64_MAX, SCNdFAST64, int_fast32_t, PRIdMAX)
    (uintmax_t, PRIuMAX, _Noreturn):
    Define to reasonable values if it's an older compiler.
    * scheck.c (scheck): Add support for arbitrary formats, such as
    those that SCNdFAST64 can expand to, at the price of no longer
    supporting weird conversion specs like "%[%]".
    * strftime.c (_fmt): Use intmax_t and uintmax_t to format time_t,
    not long and unsigned long.
    * zdump.c (int_fast32_t, intmax_t, PRIdMAX, SCNdMAX):
    Define for pre-C99 compilers, like private.h does.
    (delta, yeartot, main): Use intmax_t, not long.
    (hunt): Use time_t, not long, since the diff must be nonnegative.
    (tformat): Allow for time_t wider than long.
    * zic.c (ZIC_MIN, ZIC_MAX, SCNdZIC): New macros.
    (OFFSET_STRLEN_MAXIMUM, RULE_STRLEN_MAXIMUM): Remove.
    (struct rule): Make r_loyear, r_hiyear, r_tod, r_stdoff, z_gmtoff,
    z_stdoff zic_t, not long.
    (addtype, gethms, oadd, rpytime, tadd, gmtoffs, corr, inleap)
    (stringoffset, stringrule, outzone, addtype, adjleap, rpytime)
    (LDAYSPERWEEK):
    Use zic_t, not long.
    (leapminyear, leapmaxyear, min_year, max_year, rulesub, updateminmax)
    (outzone, rpytime):
    Use zic_t, not int.
    (usage): Now _Noreturn.
    (main): Use S_IWGRP, not 'unix', to determine whether to call umask.
    (writezone): Omit unnecessary cast.
    (mkdirs): Use HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES, not 'unix', to determine
    whether to parse DOS file anmes.
    (eitol): Remove; no longer needed.

    Adjust commentary to try to defuse recent issues somewhat.
    
    This change stemmed from a long discussion on the tz mailing list
    about what country the Jerusalem zone entry is in.  The idea of
    this change is to deemphasize the role of countries in the tz
    database, to lessen the amount of controversy in the future.
    Due to backward compatibility concerns this change does not eliminate
    the role of countries entirely.  With one minor exception this
    change does not alter any code or data, just comments.
    * Theory, zone.tab: Deemphasize the role of countries in choosing
    location names, as they tend to introduce political conflict
    during maintenance, and country information isn't needed for
    typical uses of the database.
    * Theory: Say that names should differ in more than just case, and why;
    and explain why 'backward' means old names will continue to work.
    (thanks to Norbert Lindenberg for spotting these issues).
    Update citation date and URL.
    * iso3166.tab: Mention latest maintenance update.
    Update citation URL.  Add missing comma for BQ.
    Be more consistent about abbreviating Sint like Saint.
    Mention SX "Dutch part" for consistency with MF "French part".
    * iso3166.tab, zone.tab: Add legal/territorial disclaimer.
    * zone.tab: Say that country/zone overlaps can occur in both
    directions, and that column 2 need not lie within column 1.
    (Asia/Jerusalem): Change the coordinates from a sloppy value,
    taken from an old astrology book, to a more-precise value, the
    site of city hall.  The sloppy value sparked some controversy and
    the hope is that the more-precise value will be a bit less
    controversial.

    Add support for testing time_t types other than the system's.
    
    This makes it easier to test on (say) Debian, even if we're
    testing the time_t type on (say) NetBSD.  NetBSD uses 64-bit
    time_t on 32-bit hosts, and this lets us test a NetBSD-style
    implementation (32-bit 'long', 64-bit time_t) on a 32-bit Debian host.
    * Makefile: Update comments to talk about TIME_T_FLOATING and time_tz.
    Sort the comments.
    * private.h (restrict): Define to empty with older compilers.
    'restrict' is now needed, to define gmtime_r and localtime_r in
    standard ways when time_tz is defined.
    Make the following changes if time_tz is defined:
    (sys_time, time): New static functions.  The former is the system
    'time' function that applies to the system time_t, the latter
    our function that applies to our time_t.
    (time_t, ctime, ctime_r, difftime, gmtime, gmtime_r, localtime)
    (localtime_r, mktime): Rename to tz_time_t, tz_ctime, etc.,
    via macros.  Declare the renamed versions.
    * zdump.8: Document new options -V, -t.
    * zdump.c: Include private.h if time_tz is defined.
    (INITIALIZE): Remove; no longer needed.
    (absolute_min_time, absolute_max_time): Work even if time_t
    is wider than intmax_t, which can be true with GCC and __int128_t.
    Use the new TIME_T_FLOATING macro for this.
    (usage): Document new flags.
    (main): Support them.

    Thanks to Petr Machata for reporting some of the bugs, in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2013-March/018814.html>.
    
    * asia (Palestine, Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron): Incorporates the latest info
    from timeanddate.com about Palestine.  When combined with the previous
    (incorrect) patch this incorporates the following changes for Gaza and
    Hebron:
    
      The spring 2008 change in Gaza and Hebron was on 00:00 Mar 28, not
      00:00 Apr 1.
    
      The fall 2009 change in Gaza and Hebron on Sep 4 was at 01:00, not
      02:00.
    
      The spring 2010 change in Hebron was 00:00 Mar 26, not 00:01 Mar 27.
      timeanddate.com's table says 02:00, but the text at
      <http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/gaza-and-west-bank-dst-2010.html>
      says 00:00.
    
      The spring 2011 change in Gaza was 00:01 Apr 1, not 12:01 Apr 2.
      timeanddate's table says 00:00, but the text at
      <http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/west-bank-starts-dst-2011.html>
      says 00:01.
    
      The spring 2011 change in Hebron on Apr 1 was at 00:01, not 12:01.
    
      The fall 2011 change in Hebron on Sep 30 was at 00:00, not 03:00.
    
      From 2013 on, Gaza and Hebron both observe DST, with the predicted
      rules being the last Thursday in March at 24:00 to the first Friday on
      or after September 21 at 01:00.

    Improve logic of zic -v abbreviation-length check.
    
    This fixes a bunch of "time zone abbreviation has more than 3
    alphabetics" diagnostics for 'make check_public'.
    * zic.c (newabbr): Check for <3 alphabetics, not for >3.
    POSIX-2008 requires at least 3 and says that it's not portable to
    use more than 6, which we check elsewhere.

    More C modernization.
    
    * Makefile (typecheck): Add -D__time_t_defined to CFLAGS,
    for glibc 2.15.
    * asctime.c (asctime_r, asctime):
    * date.c (main, dogmt, reset, nondigit, sametm, convert, checkfinal):

    Omit 'register', as it adds no value these days.  See Christos Zoulas in
    <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2012-October/018376.html>.
    * date.c (netsettime) [TSP_SETDATE]: Add forward decl.
    Don't rely on implicit int.  Now static.  Use NULL, not 0.
    * zdump.c: Include "limits.h".
    (absolute_min_time, absolute_max_time): Compute at compile-time,
    as the run-time tests relied on undefined behavior.
    (checkabsolutes): Rename from setabsolutes.  Just check, since
    there's nothing to set now.  All uses changed.

Date:   Fri Oct 12 07:53:12 2012 -0700

    Assume C89.
    
    * Makefile (GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS): Modernize for GCC 4.6.3 x86.
    * asctime.c (asctime_r, asctime):
    * date.c (main, dogmt, reset, wildinput, nondigit, oops, display)
    (timeout, sametm, netsettime):
    * difftime.c (difftime):
    * ialloc.c (icatalloc, icpyalloc):
    * localtime.c (detzcode, detzcode64, differ_by_repeat)
    (tzload, typesequiv, getzname, getnum, getsecs, getoffset)
    (getrule, transtime, tzparse, gmtload, tzsetwall, tzset)
    (localsub, localtime, localtime_r, gmtsub, gmtime, gmtime_r)
    (offtime, leaps_thru_end_of, timesub, ctime, ctime_r)
    (increment_overflow, long_increment_overflow)
    (normalize_overflow, long_normalize_overflow, tmcomp, time2sub)
    (time2, time1, mktime, timelocal, timegm, timeoff, gtime)
    (leapcorr, time2posix, posix2time):
    * scheck.c (scheck):
    * strftime.c (strftime, _fmt, _conv, _add, _yconv, _loc):
    * zdump.c (my_localtime, abbrok, usage, main, yeartot)

    (itsabbr, byword, getfields, oadd, tadd, rpytime, newabbr)
    (mkdirs, eitol):
    Assume C89 or better.  Mostly this consists of using function
    prototypes.  In a few places, prototypes are required for
    portability to hosts where time_t does not promote to itself and
    where a preceding prototype does not override a definition.  But
    while we're at it we might as well be consistent: it's safe to
    assume at-least-C89 these days.
    * ialloc.c (nonzero, imalloc, icalloc, irealloc, ifree, icfree):
    Remove; no longer needed now that we assume C89 or better.
    All callers changed to use malloc, calloc, realloc, free.
    * localtime.c (getzname, getqzname, leaps_thru_end_of, transtime):
    * zdump.c (delta, yeartot):
    * zic.c (eitol):
    Now pure.
    * private.h, zdump.c (ATTRIBUTE_PURE): New macro.
    * private.h (icalloc, imalloc, irealloc, icfree, ifree): Remove decls.
    * zic.c: Remove no-longer-necessary forward decls.
    (max_time, min_time): Now const.
    (setboundaries): Remove.

    (TZCODE_VERSION, TZDATA_VERSION): Remove.  All uses changed.
    (version.h): Call the variable TZVERSION, not TZCODE_VERSION.
    All uses changed.
    (tzselect): Interpolate TZVERSION, not TZCODE_VERSION.
    (public): Adjust to new versioning scheme.
